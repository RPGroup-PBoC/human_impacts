## Experimental Protocol

1. A strip of double-sticky tape was mounted on a glass slide.
2. Sample (listed in materials above) was harvested from crossing vials at **XX TIME HARVESTED** by flushing with CO_2_ and swiping with a wet paintbrush.
2. Embryos were dechorionated with 50% bleach for 20 - 30 seconds before being thoroughly washed with water. 
3. A strip of apple juice agarose was cut and mounted on a stereo microscope. Between 5 and 10 embryos were picked and mounted down the centerline of the agarose.
4. The embryos were transferred to the tape by gently pressing the tape-covered slide against the agarose pad. 
5. Two more strips of tape were mounted on either side of the embryos to create a channel approximately 5mm wide and two layers deep.
6. 20ÂµL of halocarbon oil was transferred to the channel followed by a cover slip. 
7. Embryos were mounted on an inverted microscope. Between 5 and 10 positions were marked and a time lapse was acquired with the following parameters.
    * Channel: Brightfield
    * Exposure: **EXPOSURE**
    * Autofocus settings: **AUTOFOCUS SETTINGS**
    * Time interval: **TIME INTERVAL**
    * Number of frame: **FRAME NUMBER**
8. After the time lapse had completed, embryos were thrown in biological waste and data was transferred to the backup server.
