## `templates`
While you may repeat an experiment many, many (many) times. **you must never
directly copy one day's folder and simply rename the files!** This is a
recipe for disaster and confusion as you may forget to change a detail that
is critical to the functioning of the experiment. 

In this directory, you can store templates of your experiment descriptions
and processing scripts such that updating them for each experiment is simple.
In the example `README.md` file, I've put parameters that need to be changed in
bold capitalized text so it is easy to review.  While it may be tempting, **never copy one experimental folder to another, even if you know it's exactly identical.** It takes only a few minutes to read through a file and change a handful of parameters and can save you much misery in the future.
