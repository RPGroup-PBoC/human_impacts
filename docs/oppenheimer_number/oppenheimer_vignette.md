Seventy five years ago -- on July 16, 1945 at 5:30 AM Mountain War Time
-- the first nuclear fission device was tested in Alamogordo, New Mexico.
Suspended ≈ 800 km above the desert floor, the so-called "Trinity Gadget"
detonated, releasing 92 TJ of energy leaving a 10 m wide crater 2 m deep. Some
30 km way, a group of observers watched the detonation through sheets of
welder's glass, a sight all of which agreed could not be accurately captured in
words and "had to be seen to be believed", though none hoped it would need to be
witnessed.

One such observer was J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of Los Alamos
National Laboratory and leader of the Manhattan Project writ large. While he
would vocally oppose the expansion of the nuclear weapons program a decade
later (and particularly the development of the ultra-high yield thermonuclear
fusion bombs that defined the cold war), Oppenheimer is often referred to as
the "Father of the Atomic Bomb" and his oversight of the Manhattan project
more broadly ushered in anew age colloquially termed "The Atomic Age". Many
years later, Oppenheimer reflected on the reactions of those witnessing the
July 16 test noting that while some were laughing, some were crying, and
others stood in silence, they all "knew that the world would not be the
same."

Indeed, the development, testing, and deployment of nuclear weapons has had
an enormous cultural and societal impact. Beyond an anthropocentric view, the
≈500 above-ground nuclear weapons tests between 1945 and present day (HuID:
35849) have released an impressive amount of long- and intermediate-lived
radionuclides into the Earth system, leaving our indelible mark in the
geologic history of the planet. Intermediate-lifetime radionuclides such as
$^{137}$Cs and $^{90}$Sr, with half-lives of ≈30 years, have been used
extensively as natural probes to measure rates of soil erosion and
displacement [@zapata2003]. However, we are approaching sixty years (or two
half-lives) since these nuclides were deposited en masse in the atmosphere,
making them harder to quantify. In some region where the fallout of
$^{137}$Cs and $^{90}$Sr were low, their deposits in stratified soil is now
approaching the limit of detection.

Longer-lived radionuclides such as $^{239}$Pu, $^{240}$Pu, $^{14}$C, and
$^{129}$I -- with half-lives of ≈ 24 000 yr, ≈ 6500 yr, ≈ 5700 yr, and ≈ 15
Myr, respectively -- are present in stratified soils at activity levels
essentially unchanged from that when they were initially deposited in the
mid-1960's. Of these, $^{239}$Pu and $^{240}$Pu have recently been proposed
to be the best chronological markers for the onset of the anthropocene due to
their long half-lives, global distribution, low mobility in stratified soils,
and the fact that plutonium is so rarely produced via natural processes as to
be negligible [@hancock2014]. In this vignette, we will explore how the
deposition of plutonium isotopes into the Earth geochemical cycles will serve
as a geological marker for the presence of humans, even long after we are
likely gone.
