# Introduction 

The advent of agriculture -- the science of maintaining, rearing, and
expanding the cultivation of crops and animals for food security -- is
defining feature of humanity and is often credited with being the principal
development that enables sedentary human civilization. While the harvesting
of wild (i.e. not cultivated) grains has been documented as far back as
100,000 years, the specified growth and harvesting of plants and animals
dates back to $\approx$ 11,000 BCE, with many of the staple animal protein sources
(cattle, swine, and poultry) being domesticated within the past 10,000 years.
It is not hyperbolic to state that the pursuit of food security is the
primary driving force of human society.

With approximately $\approx$ 7 $\cdot 10^9$ people on the planet today, each
consuming $\approx$ 2000 kcal per day, our agricultural output must be on the order
of $\sim 10^{14}$ consumable kJ per day. How have humans transformed the Earth to
reliably meet this threshold? In this series of vignettes, we will explore
the magnitude of human agriculture and its impact on the planet. Namely, we
will consider three distinct “footprints” of agriculture.

Our first category, the physical footprint of agriculture, will consider the
numbers and biomass of food sources on the planet under agricultural
maintenance as well as the space on which they are grown and harvested. In
doing so, we will rely on a series of data sets collected over the past
$\approx$ 50 years from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
Statistical Resources (FAOSTAT) as well as myriad industry data sets
capturing the nutritional requirements of livestock and annual feed
production. We will conclude our summary of the physical footprint by
providing a handful of key numbers that put our production of food product
in a relatable scale. These numbers will drive our pursuit of the next two
footprints.

progress on the corresponding estimations.]
