  abstract = {A field experiment to determine the effect of plant population densities on maize was conducted at the Agricultural Research Institute, Dera Ismail Khan, in mid July 2009. The effect of six plant population densities i.e. T1 (40000 plants ha\textendash 1), T2 (60000 plant ha\textendash 1), T3 (80000 plants ha\textendash 1), T4 (100000 plants ha\textendash 1), T5 (120,000 plants ha\textendash 1) and T6 (140,000 plants ha\textendash 1) was investigated using maize variety Azam. Results showed that plant population of 40000 ha\textendash 1 produced maximum number of grains per row (32.33) and grains per ear (447.3). However, 60000 plants ha\textendash 1 produced the maximum number of ears per plant (1.33), number of grain rows per ear (15.44), biomass yield (16890 kg ha\textendash 1) and grain yield (2604 kg ha\textendash 1). Therefore, planting density of 60000 plants ha\textendash 1 (keeping plant to plant distance of 22.70cm) is recommended for obtaining higher yield of maize.},

  abstract = {A general belief across the dairy community, both scientific and commercial, is that of an antagonistic association between milk production and reproductive performance of dairy cows. In this article, we critically review the evidence supporting this belief and discuss some of its limitations. Based on the fundamental principles of experimental design and inference, we consider relevant issues that, although critical to the very foundation of the perceived production\textendash reproduction antagonism, seem to have been previously misrepresented or overlooked. In particular, we focus on issues of confounding, randomization, nature of inference, single- versus multiple-trait modeling, cow- versus herdlevel modeling, and scope of inference, all within the context of dairy production systems. Taken together, these issues indicate that the production\textendash reproduction antagonism may not be as pervasive as previously believed, suggesting the need for more rigorous methods of scientific investigation on this matter. We revisit the association between milk production and reproductive performance using a novel interdisciplinary approach based on cutting-edge statistical methods that accommodate some of the unique and previously ignored features of this problem. In fact, recent work supports a highly heterogeneous association between milk production and reproductive performance, whereby heterogeneity is partitioned across several scales and driven by many contributing factors, both physiological and managerial. We conclude that the relationship between milk production and reproductive performance is not necessarily that of a universal homogeneous antagonism and suggest better ways to study and even manage this association. A more comprehensive assessment that draws expertise from multiple scientific disciplines will be required to elicit management recommendations targeted to effectively optimize overall performance of dairy cows and commercial herds.},

To determine the effects of a high protein meal (beef) compared to a moderate protein, high fiber meal (beans) on subjective appetite and energy intake at a subsequent meal twenty-eight adults, 14 men (ages 24 {$\pm$} 5 y, BMI 23 {$\pm$} 2 kg/m2) and 14 women (ages 25 {$\pm$} 5 y, BMI 22 {$\pm$} 2 kg/m2) consumed 2 test lunches containing a ``meatloaf'' made from either beef or beans. The beef meal provided 26 g of protein and 3 g of fiber while the bean meal provided 17 g of protein and 12 g of fiber. An ad libitum snack was given 3 h after the test meal. Visual analogue scales were used to assess hunger, satiety, fullness, and prospective food intake. Gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance was assessed over 24 h. No difference between the beef and bean was observed for appetite ratings over 3 h, food intake at the subsequent meal (632 {$\pm$} 75 kcal compared with 611 {$\pm$} 75 kcal, respectively), or sum of GI score (2.2 {$\pm$} 0.5 compared with 2.9 {$\pm$} 0.5, respectively). Gas and bloating were reported more often after the bean meal than the beef meal (2.0 {$\pm$} 0.4 compared with 1.3 {$\pm$} 0.4, P value 0.057). A beef-based meal with high protein and a bean-based meal with moderate protein and high fiber produced similar satiety, while the bean-based meal resulting in higher, yet moderate, gas and bloating.},

  abstract = {The high environmental costs of raising livestock are now widely appreciated, yet consumption of animal-based food items continues and is expanding throughout the world. Consumers' ability to distinguish among, and rank, various interchangeable animal-based items is crucial to reducing environmental costs of diets. However, the individual environmental burdens exerted by the five dominant livestock categories \textendash{} beef, dairy, poultry, pork and eggs \textendash{} are not fully known. Quantifying those burdens requires splitting livestock`s relatively well-known total environmental costs (e.g. land and fertilizer use for feed production) into partial categorical costs. Because such partitioning quantifies the relative environmental desirability of various animal-based food items, it is essential for environmental impact minimization efforts to be made. Yet to date, no such partitioning method exists. The present paper presents such a partitioning method for feed production-related environmental burdens. This approach treated each of the main feed classes individually \textendash{} concentrates (grain, soy, by-products; supporting production of all livestock), processed roughage (mostly hay and silage) and pasture \textendash{} which is key given these classes' widely disparate environmental costs. It was found that for the current US food system and national diet, concentrates are partitioned as follows: beef 0{$\cdot$}21{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}112, poultry 0{$\cdot$}27{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}046, dairy 0{$\cdot$}24{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}041, pork 0{$\cdot$}23{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}093 and eggs 0{$\cdot$}04{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}018. Pasture and processed roughage, consumed only by cattle, are 0{$\cdot$}92{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}034 and 0{$\cdot$}87{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}031 due to beef, with the remainder due to dairy. In a follow-up paper, the devised methodology will be employed to partition total land, irrigated water, greenhouse gases and reactive nitrogen burdens incurred by feed production among the five edible livestock categories.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) use in agriculture substantially alters global N cycle with the short- and long-term effects on global warming and climate change. It increases emission of nitrous oxide, which contributes 6.2\%, while carbon dioxide and methane contribute 76\% and 16\%, respectively of the global warming. However, N causes cooling due to emission of NOx, which alters concentrations of tropospheric ozone and methane. NOx and NH3 also form aerosols with considerable cooling effects. We studied global temperature change potential (GTP) of N use in agriculture. The GTP due to N2O was 396.67 and 1168.32 Tg CO2e on a 20-year (GTP20) and 439.94 and 1295.78 Tg CO2e on 100-year scale (GTP100) during years 1961 and 2010, respectively. Cooling effects due to N use were 92.14 and 271.39 Tg CO2e (GTP20) and 15.21 and 44.80 Tg CO2e (GTP100) during 1961 and 2010, respectively. Net GTP20 was 369.44 and 1088.15 Tg CO2e and net GTP100 was 429.17 and 1264.06 Tg CO2e during 1961 and 2010, respectively. Thus net GTP20 is lower by 6.9\% and GTP100 by 2.4\% compared to the GTP considering N2O emission alone. The study shows that both warming and cooling effects should be considered to estimate the GTP of N use.},

Twin row planting arrangement, P fertility, and hybrid selection may be important components of managing increased plant density. Our hypotheses were (i) that twin row planting arrangement would be superior to traditional 0.76-m rows at ultra-high densities and (ii) that supplemental P fertility would alleviate inter-plant competition. In 2010 and 2011, twin row planting arrangement was compared to single 0.76-m rows across densities ranging from 61,775 to 160,615 plants ha\textendash 1 and P fertility treatments ranging from 0 to 168 kg P2O5 ha\textendash 1. Twin rows did not increase yield relative to single rows, and twin rows o en yielded signi cantly less at plant densities greater than 111,195 plants ha\textendash 1. Mean responses to supplemental fertility were 1.0 and 0.3 Mg ha\textendash 1 in 2010 and 2011, respectively. ere was no interaction between plant density and P fertility suggesting that extra resource availability does not necessarily overcome inter-plant competition. In 2011, two hybrids of contrasting ear type were included to explore the role of hybrid selection in plant density response. Maximum yields of each hybrid were achieved at contrasting densities, and genetic di erences in plant density tolerance appeared to be related to (i) kernel number response on a per-area basis and (ii) stability of individual kernel weight. ese results highlight the importance of independently optimizing row spacing and soil fertility while understanding the plant density response characteristics of maize hybrids.},

Reduced bone stability in laying hens is frequently attributed to long-term selection for increased egg production. The present study sought to analyse the relationship between bone stability traits and egg production. The study comprised four purebred layer lines, differing in their phylogenetic origin and performance level, providing extended insight into the phenotypic variability in bone characteristics in laying hens. Data collection included basic production parameters, bone morphometry, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone breaking strength (BBS) of the tibiotarsus and humerus. Using a multifactorial model and regression analyses, BMD proved to be of outstanding importance for bone stability. Only for the tibiotarsus were morphometric parameters and the bone weight associated with BBS. Within the chicken lines, no effect of total eggshell production on BBS or BMD could be detected, suggesting that a high egg yield itself is not necessarily a risk for poor bone health. Considering the complexity of osteoporosis, the estimated genetic parameters confirmed the importance of genetics in addressing the challenge of improving bone strength in layers.},

  abstract = {Since the domestication of plant and animal species around 10,000 years ago, cultivation and animal husbandry have been major components of global change. Agricultural activities such as tillage, fertilization, and biomass alteration lead to fundamental changes in the pools and fluxes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) that originally existed in native ecosystems. Land is often taken out of agricultural production for economic, social, or biological reasons, and the ability to predict the biogeochemical trajectory of this land is important to our understanding of ecosystem development and our projections of food security for the future. Tillage generally decreases soil organic matter (SOM) due to erosion and disruption of the physical, biochemical, and chemical mechanisms of SOM stabilization, but SOM can generally reaccumulate after the cessation of cultivation. The use of organic amendments causes increases in SOM on agricultural fields that can last for centuries to millennia after the termination of applications, although the locations that provide the organic amendments are concurrently depleted. The legacy of agriculture is therefore highly variable on decadal to millennial time scales and depends on the specific management practices that are followed during the agricultural period. State factors such as climate and parent material (particularly clay content and mineralogy) modify ecosystem processes such that they may be useful predictors of rates of postagricultural biogeochemical change. In addition to accurate biogeochemical budgets of postagricultural systems, ecosystem models that more explicitly incorporate mechanisms of SOM loss and formation with agricultural practices will be helpful. Developing this predictive capacity will aid in ecological restoration efforts and improve the management of modern agroecosystems as demands on agriculture become more pressing.},

The remaining 61\% is often referred to as the ``Hanging Weight'' or the weight ``On the Rail''. But, the loss doesn't stop there. Once the carcass is on the rail it begins to leach moisture (shrink) which accounts for additional weight loss. This along with the fat and bone removed during the cutting account for an additional 18\% loss. In summary , a steer weighing 1, 000 pounds on the hoof will average around 430 pounds of retail cuts (steaks, roasts, ground beef, stew beef, etc.).},

  abstract = {Livestock contributes directly to the livelihoods and food security of almost a billion people and affects the diet and health of many more. With estimated standing populations of 1.43 billion cattle, 1.87 billion sheep and goats, 0.98 billion pigs, and 19.60 billion chickens, reliable and accessible information on the distribution and abundance of livestock is needed for a many reasons. These include analyses of the social and economic aspects of the livestock sector; the environmental impacts of livestock such as the production and management of waste, greenhouse gas emissions and livestock-related land-use change; and large-scale public health and epidemiological investigations. The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, produced in 2007, provided modelled livestock densities of the world, adjusted to match official (FAOSTAT) national estimates for the reference year 2005, at a spatial resolution of 3 minutes of arc (about 5\texttimes 5 km at the equator). Recent methodological improvements have significantly enhanced these distributions: more up-to date and detailed sub-national livestock statistics have been collected; a new, higher resolution set of predictor variables is used; and the analytical procedure has been revised and extended to include a more systematic assessment of model accuracy and the representation of uncertainties associated with the predictions. This paper describes the current approach in detail and presents new global distribution maps at 1 km resolution for cattle, pigs and chickens, and a partial distribution map for ducks. These digital layers are made publically available via the Livestock Geo-Wiki (http://www.livestock.geo-wiki.org), as will be the maps of other livestock types as they are produced.},

  abstract = {Food loss is widely recognized as undermining food security and environmental sustainability. However, consumption of resource-intensive food items instead of more efficient, equally nutritious alternatives can also be considered as an effective food loss. Here we define and quantify these opportunity food losses as the food loss associated with consuming resource-intensive animal-based items instead of plant-based alternatives which are nutritionally comparable, e.g., in terms of protein content. We consider replacements that minimize cropland use for each of the main US animal-based food categories. We find that although the characteristic conventional retail-to-consumer food losses are {$\approx$}30\% for plant and animal products, the opportunity food losses of beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs are 96\%, 90\%, 75\%, 50\%, and 40\%, respectively. This arises because plant-based replacement diets can produce 20-fold and twofold more nutritionally similar food per cropland than beef and eggs, the most and least resource-intensive animal categories, respectively. Although conventional and opportunity food losses are both targets for improvement, the high opportunity food losses highlight the large potential savings beyond conventionally defined food losses. Concurrently replacing all animal-based items in the US diet with plant-based alternatives will add enough food to feed, in full, 350 million additional people, well above the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food waste. These results highlight the importance of dietary shifts to improving food availability and security.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Life cycle assessment has become an increasingly common approach for identifying, quantifying, and evaluating the total potential environmental impact of production processes or products, from the procurement of raw materials (the `cradle'), to production and utilization (the `gates') and their final storage (the `grave'), as well as for determining ways to repair damage to the environment. The paper describes life cycle assessment of mineral fertilizers. On the basis of results provided by life cycle assessment, it can be concluded that an effective strategy for protecting the environment against the harmful effects of fertilizers is to attempt to `seal' the nutrient cycle on a global, regional, and local scale. Pro-environ- mental measures aim on the one hand to reduce resource utilization, and on the other hand to limit losses of nutrients, during both production and use of fertilizers. An undoubted challenge for life cycle assessment when used in agricultural production is the need for relevance at each scale.},

  abstract = {Artificial selection of broiler chickens for commercial objectives has been employed at an unprecedented magnitude over the recent decades. Consequently, the number of days, total feed and in turn energy, required to raise a broiler to slaughter weight, have decreased dramatically. Feed provision is the poultry industry's biggest environmental hotspot; hence, understanding the interactions between the birds' genetic change and their energy use efficiency forms the necessary starting point for quantifying and predicting and thereby mitigating the future environmental impact of the poultry sector. This review assesses the consequences of artificial selection on the following traits: digestive efficiency, body composition and utilisation of metabolisable energy for growth and metabolic activity. The main findings were (1) the digestive system has been subjected to much physical change due to selection in the recent decades, but this has not led to any apparent change in digestion efficiency. (2) Both the energy intake per day and the metabolic heat production rate have increased in the recent decades whilst (3) the efficiency of utilising energy for growth has also increased; this is due to an increased growth rate, so that broilers reach slaughter weight more quickly and therefore need to allocate less energy overall to metabolic processes, with the exception of growth. (4) There may have been a reduction in the tendency to waste feed through spillage and carry out energetically expensive behaviors. There is a discrepancy in the literature with regards to the influence of selection on body composition and its contribution to feed efficiency. In this review, two scenarios are demonstrated, whereby body composition either has or has not altered via artificial selection. Understanding the effects of artificial selection on the traits that relate to the feed efficiency of the broilers will contribute towards the reduction of the environmental impacts that arise from such systems.},

Two hundred twenty-four mixed-sex broilers were reared under commercial-like conditions for various periods between 37 and 51 d, slaughtered, packed in ice, and then aged for 0, 2, 4, or 6 h. Mean percentage yield of thighs, drumsticks, forequarters, wings, breasts, and filets were evaluated for each rearing period, sex, and postmortem aging duration. Yield of meatier parts such as thighs, forequarters, breasts, and filets increased with birds' ages. Female carcasses produced higher percentage yields of forequarters, breasts, and filets but lower yields of drumsticks. Carcasses aged 2 h or more postmortem tended to have lower yields of forequarters, breasts, and drumsticks than did carcasses aged for shorter durations. No statistically significant interactions among age, sex, or postmortem aging duration that affected yield of parts were detected. This information is useful to integrated poultry firms wishing to optimize yield of the most commercially valuable parts.},

The egg confers a multitude of health benefits to consumers emphasizing its classification as a functional food. Current global per capita egg consumption estimates approach 9 kg annually but vary greatly on a regional basis. This review deals with global production, consumption, and management aspects such as hygiene, feeding, and housing. Management aspects play key roles in the composition, quality, food safety, and visual (consumer) appeal of the egg. Also the manipulation of egg nutrients and value for human health is discussed.},

Increased interest in this concept is attributed to problems associated with early life fast growth rate, especially in broilers fed ad libitum. These problems include high body fat deposition, and a high incidence of skeletal and metabolic disorders. Factors that influence compensatory growth in the broiler chicken include the nature, severity and duration of undernutrition, as well as the age at the commencement of undernutrition and the degree and pattern of realimentation. Many studies have reported improvement in feed efficiency during compensatory growth in restricted-refed broilers. Broiler chickens undergoing compensatory growth also exhibit greater than normal feed intake relative to body weight and some associated digestive adaptation. The use of this concept to address problems associated with early life fast growth rate requires more studies of the nutrition of the broiler chicken during the period of growth compensation.},

  abstract = {The effect of commercial selection on the growth, efficiency, and yield of broilers was studied using 2 University of Alberta Meat Control strains unselected since 1957 and 1978, and a commercial Ross 308 strain (2005). Mixed-sex chicks (n = 180 per strain) were placed into 4 replicate pens per strain, and grown on a current nutritional program to 56 d of age. Weekly front and side profile photographs of 8 birds per strain were collected. Growth rate, feed intake, and measures of feed efficiency including feed conversion ratio, residual feed intake, and residual maintenance energy requirements were characterized. A nonlinear mixed Gompertz growth model was used to predict BW and BW variation, useful for subsequent stochastic growth simulation. Dissections were conducted on 8 birds per strain semiweekly from 21 to 56 d of age to characterize allometric growth of pectoralis muscles, leg meat, abdominal fat pad, liver, gut, and heart. A novel nonlinear analysis of covariance was used to test the hypothesis that allometric growth patterns have changed as a result of commercial selection pressure. From 1957 to 2005, broiler growth increased by over 400\%, with a concurrent 50\% reduction in feed conversion ratio, corresponding to a compound annual rate of increase in 42 d live BW of 3.30\%. Forty-two-day FCR decreased by 2.55\% each year over the same 48-yr period. Pectoralis major growth potential increased, whereas abdominal fat decreased due to genetic selection pressure over the same time period. From 1957 to 2005, pectoralis minor yield at 42 d of age was 30\% higher in males and 37\% higher in females; pectoralis major yield increased by 79\% in males and 85\% in females. Over almost 50 yr of commercial quantitative genetic selection pressure, intended beneficial changes have been achieved. Unintended changes such as enhanced sexual dimorphism are likely inconsequential, though musculoskeletal, immune function, and parent stock management challenges may require additional attention in future selection programs.},
