  abstract = {A statistical thermodynamic model has been developed to account for the cooperative interactions of the bacteriophage A repressor with the A right operator. The model incorporates a general theory for quantitatively interpreting cooperative site-specific equilibrium binding data. Values for all interaction parameters of the model have been evaluated at 37TC, 0.2 M KCI, from results of DNase protection experiments in vitro [A. D. Johnson, B. J. Meyer, \& M. Ptashne, Procx NatL Acad. Sci. USA (1979) 76, 5061-5065]. With these values, the model predicts repression curves at the divergent promoters PR and PRM that control transcription of genes coding for the regulatory proteins cro and repressor, respectively. At physiological repressor concentrations, repression at Pn is predicted to be nearly complete whereas PRM is predicted to remain highly active. The results demonstrate the importance of cooperative interactions between repressor dimers bound to the adjacent operator sites OR' and OR2 in maintaining a stable lysogenic state and in allowing efficient switchover to the lytic state during induction.},

All the methods were applied to a sample from Escherichia coli chemostat culture. A Pearson squared correlation of approximately 0.6 among the three quantification methods was demonstrated. Importantly, the sum of quantified proteins by iBAQ and emPAI corresponded with the Lowry total protein quantification, demonstrating applicability of label-free methods for an accurate calculation of protein concentrations at the proteome level. The iBAQ method showed the best correlation between biological replicates, a normal distribution among all protein abundances, and the lowest variation among ribosomal protein abundances, which are expected to have equal amounts. Absolute quantitative proteome data enabled us to evaluate metabolic cost for protein synthesis and apparent catalytic activities of enzymes by integration with flux analysis. All the methods demonstrated similar ATP costs for protein synthesis for different cellular processes and that costs for expressing biomass synthesis related proteins were higher than those for energy generation. Importantly, catalytic activities of energy metabolism enzymes were an order or two higher than those of monomer synthesis. Interestingly, a staircase-like protein expression was demonstrated for most of the transcription units.},

  abstract = {Ammonia is a biologically potent molecule, and the regulation of ammonia levels in the mammalian body is, therefore, strictly controlled. The molecular paths of ammonia permeation across plasma membranes remain ill-defined, but the structural similarity of water and NH3 has pointed to the aquaporins as putative NH3-permeable pores. Accordingly, a range of aquaporins from mammals, plants, fungi, and protozoans demonstrates ammonia permeability. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is highly expressed at perivascular glia end-feet in the mammalian brain and may, with this prominent localization at the blood-brain-interface, participate in the exchange of ammonia, which is required to sustain the glutamate-glutamine cycle. Here we observe that AQP4-expressing Xenopus oocytes display a reflection coefficient {$<$}1 for NH4Cl at pH 8.0, at which pH an increased amount of the ammonia occurs in the form of NH3. Taken together with an NH4Cl-mediated intracellular alkalization (or lesser acidification) of AQP4-expressing oocytes, these data suggest that NH3 is able to permeate the pore of AQP4. Exposure to NH4Cl increased the membrane currents to a similar extent in uninjected oocytes and in oocytes expressing AQP4, indicating that the ionic NH4+ did not permeate AQP4. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed partial pore permeation events of NH3 but not of NH4+ and a reduced energy barrier for NH3 permeation through AQP4 compared with that of a cholesterol-containing lipid bilayer, suggesting AQP4 as a favored transmembrane route for NH3. Our data propose that AQP4 belongs to the growing list of NH3-permeable water channels.},

These five subunit membrane proteins have two allosteric (transmitter) binding sites and a distant ion channel domain. Occupation of the binding sites by agonist molecules transiently increases the probability that the channel is ion-permeable. Recent experiments show that the Monod, Wyman and Changeux formalism for allosteric proteins, originally developed for haemoglobin, is an excellent model for acetylcholine receptors. By using mutations and single-channel electrophysiology, the gating equilibrium constants for receptors with zero, one or two bound agonist molecules, and the agonist association and dissociation rate constants from both the closed- and open-channel conformations, have been estimated experimentally. The change in affinity for each transmitter molecule between closed and open conformations provides {$\sim$}\textendash 5.1 kcal mol-1 towards the global gating isomerization of the protein.},

However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the {$\approx$}550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants ({$\approx$}450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals ({$\approx$}2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria ({$\approx$}70 Gt C) and archaea ({$\approx$}7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of {$\approx$}6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding how the homeostasis of cellular size and composition is accomplished by different organisms is an outstanding challenge in biology. For exponentially growing Escherichia coli cells, it is long known that the size of cells exhibits a strong positive relation with their growth rates in different nutrient conditions. Here, we characterized cell sizes in a set of orthogonal growth limitations. We report that cell size and mass exhibit positive or negative dependences with growth rate depending on the growth limitation applied. In particular, synthesizing large amounts of ?useless? proteins led to an inversion of the canonical, positive relation, with slow growing cells enlarged 7- to 8-fold compared to cells growing at similar rates under nutrient limitation. Strikingly, this increase in cell size was accompanied by a 3- to 4-fold increase~in cellular DNA content at slow growth, reaching up to an amount equivalent to \textasciitilde 8 chromosomes per cell. Despite drastic changes in cell mass and macromolecular composition, cellular dry mass density remained constant. Our findings reveal an important role of protein synthesis in cell division control.},

By carrying out the Nextera tagmentation reaction in small volumes, replacing costly reagents with cheaper equivalents, and omitting unnecessary steps, we achieve a cost of library preparation of \$8 per sample, approximately 6 times cheaper than the standard Nextera XT protocol. Furthermore, our procedure takes less than 5 hours for 96 samples. Several hundred samples can then be pooled on the same HiSeq lane via custom barcodes. Our method will be useful for re-sequencing of microbial or viral genomes, including those from evolution experiments, genetic screens, and environmental samples, as well as for other sequencing applications including large amplicon, open chromosome, artificial chromosomes, and RNA sequencing.},

RpoS turnover depends on ClpXP protease, the response regulator RssB, and a hitherto uncharacterized "turnover element" within RpoS itself. Here we localize the turnover element to a small element (around the crucial amino acid lysine-173) directly downstream of the promoter-recognizing region 2.4 in RpoS. Its sequence as well as its location identify the turnover element as a unique proteolysis-promoting motif. This element is shown to be a site of interaction with RssB. Thus, RssB is functionally unique among response regulators as a direct recognition factor in ClpXP-dependent RpoS proteolysis. Binding of RssB to RpoS is stimulated by phosphorylation of the RssB receiver domain, suggesting that environmental stress affects RpoS proteolysis by modulating RssB affinity for RpoS. Initial evidence indicates that lysine-173 in RpoS, besides being essential of RpoS proteolysis, may play a role in promoter recognition. Thus the same region in RpoS is crucial for proteolysis as well as for activity as a transcription factor.},

  abstract = {sigmaS (RpoS) is the master regulator of the general stress response in \emph{Escherichia coli}. Several stresses increase cellular sigmaS levels by inhibiting proteolysis of sigmaS, which under non-stress conditions is a highly unstable protein. For this ClpXP-dependent degradation, the response regulator RssB acts as a recognition factor, with RssB affinity for sigmaS being modulated by phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that RssB can also act like an anti-sigma factor for sigmaS in vivo, i.e. RssB can inhibit the expression of sigmaS-dependent genes in the presence of high sigmaS levels. This becomes apparent when (i) the cellular RssB/sigmaS ratio is at least somewhat elevated and (ii) proteolysis is reduced (for example in stationary phase) or eliminated (for example in a clpP mutant). Two modes of inhibition of sigmaS by RssB can be distinguished. The 'catalytic' mode is observed in stationary phase cells with a substoichiometric RssB/sigmaS ratio, requires ClpP and therefore probably corresponds to sequestering of sigmaS to Clp protease (even though sigmaS is not degraded). The 'stoichiometric' mode occurs in clpP mutant cells upon overproduction of RssB to levels that are equal to those of sigmaS, and therefore probably involves binary complex formation between RssB and sigmaS. We also show that, under standard laboratory conditions, the cellular level of RssB is more than 20-fold lower than that of sigmaS and is not significantly controlled by stresses that upregulate sigmaS. We therefore propose that antisigma factor activity of RssB may play a role under not yet identified growth conditions (which may result in RssB induction), or that RssB is a former antisigma factor that during evolution was recruited to serve as a recognition factor for proteolysis.},

However, while the catalog of bacterial genomes continues to expand rapidly, we remain ignorant about how almost all of the genes in these genomes are regulated. At present, characterizing the molecular mechanisms by which individual regulatory sequences operate requires focused efforts using low-throughput methods. Here, we take a first step toward multipromoter dissection and show how a combination of massively parallel reporter assays, mass spectrometry, and information-theoretic modeling can be used to dissect multiple bacterial promoters in a systematic way. We show this approach on both well-studied and previously uncharacterized promoters in the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli. In all cases, we recover nucleotide-resolution models of promoter mechanism. For some promoters, including previously unannotated ones, the approach allowed us to further extract quantitative biophysical models describing input\textendash output relationships. Given the generality of the approach presented here, it opens up the possibility of quantitatively dissecting the mechanisms of promoter function in E. coli and a wide range of other bacteria.},

  abstract = {Bacteria are subjected to a host of different environmental stresses. One such insult occurs when cells encounter changes in the osmolarity of the surrounding media resulting in an osmotic shock. In recent years, a great deal has been learned about mechanosensitive (MS) channels which are thought to provide osmoprotection in these circumstances by opening emergency release valves in response to membrane tension. However, even the most elementary physiological parameters such as the number of MS channels per cell, how MS channel expression levels influence the physiological response of the cells, and how this mean number of channels varies from cell to cell remain unanswered. In this paper, we make a detailed quantitative study of the expression of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) in different media and at various stages in the growth history of bacterial cultures. Using both quantitative fluorescence microscopy and quantitative Western blots our study complements earlier electrophysiology-based estimates and results in the following key insights: i) the mean number of channels per cell is much higher than previously estimated, ii) measurement of the single-cell distributions of such channels reveals marked variability from cell to cell and iii) the mean number of channels varies under different environmental conditions. The regulation of MscL expression displays rich behaviors that depend strongly on culturing conditions and stress factors, which may give clues to the physiological role of MscL. The number of stressinduced MscL channels and the associated variability have far reaching implications for the in vivo response of the channels and for modeling of this response. As shown by numerous biophysical models, both the number of such channels and their variability can impact many physiological processes including osmoprotection, channel gating probability, and channel clustering.},

Previously, we highly enriched the MscL protein by using patch clamp as a functional assay and cloned the corresponding gene. The predicted protein contains a largely hydrophobic core spanning two-thirds of the molecule and a more hydrophilic carboxyl terminal tail. Because MscL had no homology to characterized proteins, it was impossible to predict functional regions of the protein by simple inspection. Here, by mutagenesis, we have searched for functionally important regions of this molecule. We show that a short deletion from the amino terminus (3 amino acids), and a larger deletion of 27 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of this protein, had little if any effect in channel properties. We have thus narrowed the search of the core mechanosensitive mechanism to 106 residues of this 136-amino acid protein. In contrast, single residue substitutions of a lysine in the putative first transmembrane domain or a glutamine in the periplasmic loop caused pronounced shifts in the mechano-sensitivity curves and/or large changes in the kinetics of channel gating, suggesting that the conformational structure in these regions is critical for normal mechanosensitive channel gating.},

  abstract = {MscL is a channel found in bacterial plasma membranes that opens a large pore in response to mechanical stress. Here we demonstrate that some mutations within this channel protein (K31D and K31E) evoke a cellular phenotype in which the growth rate is severely depressed. Increasing the osmolarity of the growth medium partially rescues this "slowed growth" phenotype and decreases an abnormal cytosolic potassium loss observed in cells expressing the mutants. In addition, upon sudden decrease in osmolarity (osmotic downshock) more cytoplasmic potassium is released from cells expressing the mutants than cells expressing wild-type MscL. After osmotic downshock, all cells remained viable; hence, the differences in potassium efflux observed are not due to cell lysis but instead appear to be an exaggeration of the normal response to this sudden change in environmental osmolarity. Patch clamp studies in native bacterial membranes substantiate the hypothesis that these mutant channels are more sensitive to mechanical stresses, especially at voltages approaching those estimated for bacterial membrane potentials. These data are consistent with a crucial role for MscL in the adaptation to large osmotic downshock and suggest that if the normally tight regulation of MscL gating is disrupted, cell growth can be severely inhibited.},

The energy required to deform double-helical DNA depends on sequence, and this mechanical code of DNA influences gene regulation, such as through nucleosome positioning. Here we examine the sequence-dependent flexibility of DNA in bacterial transcription factor-mediated looping, a context for which the role of sequence remains poorly understood. Using a suite of synthetic constructs repressed by the Lac repressor and two well-known sequences that show large flexibility differences in vitro, we make precise statistical mechanical predictions as to how DNA sequence influences loop formation and test these predictions using in vivo transcription and in vitro single-molecule assays. Surprisingly, sequence-dependent flexibility does not affect in vivo gene regulation. By theoretically and experimentally quantifying the relative contributions of sequence and the DNA-bending protein HU to DNA mechanical properties, we reveal that bending by HU dominates DNA mechanics and masks intrinsic sequence-dependent flexibility. Such a quantitative understanding of how mechanical regulatory information is encoded in the genome will be a key step towards a predictive understanding of gene regulation at single-base pair resolution.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms adapt to osmotic downshifts by releasing small osmolytes through mechanosensitive (MS) channels. We want to understand how the small mechanosensitive channel's (MscS) activation and inactivation, both driven by membrane tension, optimize survival in varying hypoosmotic shock situations. By measuring light scattering with a stopped-flow device, we estimate bacterial swelling time as 30-50 ms. A partial solute equilibration follows within 150-200 ms, during which optical responses from cells with WT MscS deviate from those lacking MS channels. MscS opening rates estimated in patch clamp show the channels readily respond to tensions below the lytic limit with a time course faster than 20 ms and close promptly upon tension release. To address the role of the tension-insensitive inactivated state in vivo, we applied short, long, and two-step osmotic shock protocols to WT, noninactivating G113A, and fast-inactivating D62N mutants. WT and G113A showed a comparable survival in short 1 min 800 mOsm downshock experiments, but G113A was at a disadvantage under a long 60 min shock. Preshocking cells carrying WT MscS for 15 s to 15 min with a 200 mOsm downshift did not sensitize them to the final 500 mOsm drop in osmolarity of the second step. However, these two-step shocks induced death in D62N more than just a one-step 700 mOsm downshift. We conclude MscS is able to activate and exude osmolytes faster than lytic pressure builds inside the cell under abrupt shock. During prolonged shocks, gradual inactivation prevents continuous channel activity and assists recovery. Slow kinetics of inactivation in WT MscS ensures that mild shocks do not inactivate the entire population, leaving some protection should conditions worsen.},

The proposed role of mechanosensitive (MS) channels is the rapid and nonspecific release of solutes from the cell in response to the generation of excessive turgor pressure. This model has now been tested and verified for \emph{E. coli}. In most bacterial cells Cl- ions have not been predicted to have significant roles in cell physiology. In some halophilic bacteria Cl- is accumulated to provide salt balance during growth in very high salt concentrations. The aquaglyceroporins are pores that allow the permeation of water and small linear polyhydric molecules through the bacterial membrane. The cell faces two types of problems that relate to ammonium ions. First, there is the need to scavenge for ammonium when the concentration in the environment is low. Second, cells growing on broth may encounter a surfeit of cytoplasmic ammonium ions arising from the deamination of amino acids. In a wide range of bacterial genera the genes for AmtB and GlnK exist as an operon, and recent work suggests that the former is a pore that is used by cells to accelerate the passage of ammonium ions across the membrane and that GlnK is a specific component of the nitrogen-regulatory circuit that controls its activity. The increased understanding of mechanistic aspects of the channel selectivity and gating has advanced rapidly, but an appreciation of the role of channels in cell physiology lags well behind.},

  abstract = {Maximization of growth rate is an important fitness strategy for bacteria. Bacteria can achieve this by expressing proteins at optimal concentrations, such that resources are not wasted. This is exemplified for Escherichia coli by the increase of its ribosomal protein-fraction with growth rate, which precisely matches the increased protein synthesis demand. These findings and others have led to the hypothesis that E. coli aims to maximize its growth rate in environments that support growth. However, what kind of regulatory strategy is required for a robust, optimal adjustment of the ribosome concentration to the prevailing condition is still an open question. In the present study, we analyze the ppGpp-controlled mechanism of ribosome expression used by E. coli and show that this mechanism maintains the ribosomes saturated with its substrates. In this manner, overexpression of the highly abundant ribosomal proteins is prevented, and limited resources can be redirected to the synthesis of other growth-promoting enzymes. It turns out that the kinetic conditions for robust, optimal protein-partitioning, which are required for growth rate maximization across conditions, can be achieved with basic biochemical interactions. We show that inactive ribosomes are the most suitable `signal' for tracking the intracellular nutritional state and for adjusting gene expression accordingly, as small deviations from optimal ribosome concentration cause a huge fractional change in ribosome inactivity. We expect to find this control logic implemented across fast-growing microbial species because growth rate maximization is a common selective pressure, ribosomes are typically highly abundant and thus costly, and the required control can be implemented by a small, simple network.},

  abstract = {Multiconformation membrane proteins are mechanosensitive (MS) if their conformations displace different bilayer areas. Might MS closed-closed transitions serve as tension buffers, that is, as membrane "spandex"? While bilayer expansion is effectively instantaneous, transitions of bilayer-embedded MS proteins are stochastic (thermally activated) so spandex kinetics would be critical. Here we model generic two-state (contracted/expanded) stochastic spandexes inspired by known bacterial osmovalves (MscL, MscS) then suggest experimental approaches to test for spandex-like behaviors in these proteins. Modeling shows: 1), spandex kinetics depend on the transition state location along an area reaction coordinate; 2), increasing membrane concentration of a spandex right-shifts its midpoint (= tension-Boltzmann); 3), spandexes with midpoints below the activating tension of an osmovalve could optimize osmovalve deployment (required: large midpoint, barrier near the expanded state); 4), spandexes could damp bilayer tension excursions (required: midpoint at target tension, and for speed, barrier halfway between the contracted and expanded states; the larger the spandex Delta-area, the more precise the maintenance of target tension; higher spandex concentrations damp larger amplitude strain fluctuations). One spandex species could not excel as both first line of defense for osmovalve partners and tension damper. Possible interactions among MS closed-closed and closed-open transitions are discussed for MscS- and MscL-like proteins.},

  abstract = {The last five years have witnessed major developments in the understanding of the allosteric phenomenon, broadly defined as coupling between remote molecular sites. Such advances have been driven not only by new theoretical models and pharmacological applications of allostery, but also by progress in the experimental approaches designed to map allosteric sites and transitions. Among these techniques, NMR spectroscopy has played a major role given its unique near-atomic resolution and sensitivity to the dynamics that underlie allosteric couplings. Here, we highlight recent progress in the NMR methods tailored to investigate allostery with the goal of offering an overview of which NMR approaches are best suited for which allosterically relevant questions. The picture of the allosteric ``NMR toolbox'' is provided starting from one of the simplest models of allostery (i.e., the four-state thermodynamic cycle) and continuing to more complex multistate mechanisms. We also review how such an ``NMR toolbox'' has assisted the elucidation of the allosteric molecular basis for disease-related mutations and the discovery of novel leads for allosteric drugs. From this overview, it is clear that NMR plays a central role not only in experimentally validating transformative theories of allostery, but also in tapping the full translational potential of allosteric systems.},

Small differences that we would have cheerfully disregarded a decade ago as being due to ``experimental error'' or ``differences in technique'' suddenly become crucial\textemdash the nub of debate if not controversy. Sometimes, even, they reveal cracks in the smooth surface of current dogma and hint at unexplored layers beneath. Take, for example, the question of the ``gain'' or ``amplification'' shown by swimming bacteria when they respond to chemical attractants. Arguments about the size of this gain and whether it is consistent with the currently accepted model of signal transduction have been going on for years. Now, an innovative technique applied to the problem measures chemotactic gain with unparalleled accuracy (1). And yes, there really is something strange going on.

The story begins 30 years ago when Howard Berg and Douglas Brown at the University of Colorado used a novel three-dimensional tracking microscope they had developed to follow the swimming of individual Escherichia coli bacteria (2). Swimming was found to consist of smooth ``runs'' interrupted roughly every second by transient ``tumbles'' (or ``twiddles''). Chemotaxis\textemdash the ability of the cells to move toward distant sources of food molecules\textemdash was based on the suppression of tumbles in cells that happened by chance to be moving up the gradient. The impressive sensitivity of this process was later measured by applying attractants such as aspartate directly from a pipette onto bacteria tethered onto a coverslip (3). In this tethered-cell method, periodic reversals of rotation of individual flagellar motors are observed and the swimming performance recorded as the rotational bias \textemdash the fraction of time spent in counterclockwise rotation. The measurements of Segall et al. (3) revealed that the amplification, or gain, of \ldots},

  abstract = {One of the paramount goals of synthetic biology is to have the ability to tune transcriptional networks to targeted levels of expression at will. As a step in that direction, we have constructed a set of 18 unique binding sites for E. coli RNA Polymerase (RNAP) s70 holoenzyme, designed using a model of sequence-dependent binding energy combined with a thermodynamic model of transcription to produce a targeted level of gene expression. This promoter set allows us to determine the correspondence between the absolute numbers of mRNA molecules or protein products and the predicted promoter binding energies measured in kBT energy units. These binding sites adhere on average to the predicted level of gene expression over 3 orders of magnitude in constitutive gene expression, to within a factor of 3 in both protein and mRNA copy number. With these promoters in hand, we then place them under the regulatory control of a bacterial repressor and show that again there is a strict correspondence between the measured and predicted levels of expression, demonstrating the transferability of the promoters to an alternate regulatory context. In particular, our thermodynamic model predicts the expression from our promoters under a range of repressor concentrations between several per cell up to over 100 per cell. After correcting the predicted polymerase binding strength using the data from the unregulated promoter, the thermodynamic model accurately predicts the expression for the simple repression strains to within 30\%. Demonstration of modular promoter design, where parts of the circuit (such as RNAP/TF binding strength and transcription factor copy number) can be independently chosen from a stock list and combined to give a predictable result, has important implications as an engineering tool for use in synthetic biology.},

  abstract = {For most cells, a sudden decrease in external osmolarity results in fast water influx that can burst the cell. To survive, cells rely on the passive response of mechanosensitive channels, which open under increased membrane tension and allow the release of cytoplasmic solutes and water. Although the gating and the molecular structure of mechanosensitive channels found in \emph{Escherichia coli} have been extensively studied, the overall dynamics of the whole cellular response remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize \emph{E. coli}'s passive response to a sudden hypoosmotic shock (downshock) on a single-cell level. We show that initial fast volume expansion is followed by a slow volume recovery that can end below the initial value. Similar response patterns were observed at downshocks of a wide range of magnitudes. Although wild-type cells adapted to osmotic downshocks and resumed growing, cells of a double-mutant ([Formula: see text]) strain expanded, but failed to fully recover, often lysing or not resuming growth at high osmotic downshocks. We propose a theoretical model to explain our observations by simulating mechanosensitive channels opening, and subsequent solute efflux and water flux. The model illustrates how solute efflux, driven by mechanical pressure and solute chemical potential, competes with water influx to reduce cellular osmotic pressure and allow volume recovery. Our work highlights the vital role of mechanosensation in bacterial survival.},

While high-throughput methods have made transcriptomics and proteomics datasets widely accessible and relatively economical to generate, systematic measurements of both mRNA and protein abundances under a wide range of different conditions are still relatively rare. Here we present a detailed, genome-wide transcriptomics and proteomics dataset of E. coli grown under 34 different conditions. Additionally, we provide measurements of doubling times and in-vivo metabolic fluxes through the central carbon metabolism. We manipulate concentrations of sodium and magnesium in the growth media, and we consider four different carbon sources glucose, gluconate, lactate, and glycerol. Moreover, samples are taken both in exponential and stationary phase, and we include two extensive time-courses, with multiple samples taken between 3\,hours and 2 weeks. We find that exponential-phase samples systematically differ from stationary-phase samples, in particular at the level of mRNA. Regulatory responses to different carbon sources or salt stresses are more moderate, but we find numerous differentially expressed genes for growth on gluconate and under salt and magnesium stress. Our data set provides a rich resource for future computational modeling of E. coli gene regulation, transcription, and translation.},

The molecular water transporter remained elusive until discovery of the Escherichia coli water channel, AqpZ, however the regulation of the aqpZ gene expression and physiological function of the AqpZ protein are unknown. Northern analysis revealed a transcript of 0.7 kb, confirming the monocistronic nature of aqpZ. Regulatory studies performed with an aqpZ{$\Colon$}lacZ low copy plasmid demonstrate enhanced expression during mid-logarithmic growth, and expression of the gene is dependent upon the extracellular osmolality, which increased in hypoosmotic environments but strongly reduced in hyperosmolar NaCl or KCl. While disruption of the chromosomal aqpZ is not lethal for E. coli, the colonies of the aqpZ knockout mutant are smaller than those of the parental wild-type strain. When cocultured with parental wild-type E. coli, the aqpZ knockout mutant exhibits markedly reduced colony formation when grown at 39\textdegree C. Similarly, the aqpZ knockout mutant also exhibits greatly reduced colony formation when grown at low osmolality, but this phenotype is reversed by overexpression of AqpZ protein. These results implicate AqpZ as a participant in the adaptive response of E. coli to hypoosmotic environments and indicate a requirement for AqpZ by rapidly growing cells.},

Yet despite GPCRs representing the largest family of receptors and drug targets, no study has systematically evaluated the MWC mechanism as it applies to GPCR allosteric ligands. We reveal how the recently described allosteric modulator, benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA), behaves according to a strict, two-state MWC mechanism at the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). Despite having a low affinity for the M1 mAChR, BQCA demonstrated state dependence, exhibiting high positive cooperativity with orthosteric agonists in a manner that correlated with efficacy but negative cooperativity with inverse agonists. The activity of BQCA was significantly increased at a constitutively active M1 mAChR but abolished at an inactive mutant. Interestingly, BQCA possessed intrinsic signaling efficacy, ranging from near-quiescence to full agonism depending on the coupling efficiency of the chosen intracellular pathway. This latter cellular property also determined the difference in magnitude of positive cooperativity between BQCA and the orthosteric agonist, carbachol, across pathways. The lack of additional, pathway-biased, allosteric modulation by BQCA was confirmed in genetically engineered yeast strains expressing different chimeras between the endogenous yeast Gpa1 protein and human G{$\alpha$} subunits. These findings define a chemical biological framework that can be applied to the study and classification of allosteric modulators across different GPCR families.},

  abstract = {Understanding how distinct parts of proteins produce coordinated behavior has driven and continues to drive advances in protein science and enzymology. However, despite consensus about the conceptual basis for allostery, the idiosyncratic nature of allosteric mechanisms resists general approaches. Computational methods can identify conformational transition states from structural changes, revealing common switching mechanisms that impose multistate behavior. Thermodynamic cycles use factorial perturbations to measure coupling energies between side chains in molecular switches that mediate shear during domain motion. Such cycles have now been complemented by modular cycles that measure energetic coupling between separable domains. For one model system, energetic coupling between domains has been shown to be quantitatively equivalent to that between dynamic side chains. Linkages between domain motion, switching residues, and catalysis make nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis conditional on domain movement, confirming an essential yet neglected aspect of free energy transduction and suggesting the potential generality of these studies.},

Competitors that determine territory size, according to Voronoi diagrams, were the most important drivers of variation in colony size. However, the relative importance of different competitors changed through time. Further, the effect of location increased when colonies took up resources quickly relative to the diffusion of limiting resources. These analyses made it apparent that the importance of location was smaller than expected for experiments with S. enterica growing on glucose. The accumulation of toxic byproducts appeared to limit the growth of large colonies and reduced variation in colony size.

PBPs 1 and 2 of the resistant strains exhibited slower acylation and more rapid deacylation than susceptible strains. In contrast PBP 4, a naturally low-affinity PBP, was modified such that it exhibited a lower rate of deacylation. The concentrations of penicillin at which modified PBPs were bound correlated with concentrations that inhibited growth of the resistant strains. Acquisition of penicillin resistance in these strains of S. aureus results, at least in part, from structural modifications affecting binding of multiple PBPs and appears to include recruitment of a non-essential PBP, PBP 4.},

In an effort to better understand the structural basis for the function of these channels, the structure of the MscL homolog from Mycobacterium tuberculosis was determined by x-ray crystallography to 3.5 angstroms resolution. This channel is organized as a homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane alpha helices and a third cytoplasmic alpha helix. From the extracellular side, a water-filled opening approximately 18 angstroms in diameter leads into a pore lined with hydrophilic residues which narrows at the cytoplasmic side to an occluded hydrophobic apex that may act as the channel gate.

This creates dramatic gene expression bimodality in isogenic cell populations, as arrest abolishes gene expression. Multiscale models incorporating population dynamics, temperature-dependent growth rates, and Arrhenius scaling of reaction rates captured the effects of cooling, but not those of heating in resistant cells. Molecular-dynamics simulations revealed how heating alters the conformational dynamics of the TetR repressor, fully explaining the experimental observations. Overall, nonoptimal temperatures induce a cell fate decision and corrupt gene and gene network function in computationally predictable ways, which may aid future applications of engineered microbes in nonstandard temperatures.},

Recent research has shown that, just like for conventional classification, instance-based learning algorithms relying on the nearest neighbor estimation principle can be used quite successfully in this context. However, since hitherto existing algorithms do not take correlations and interdependencies between labels into account, their potential has not yet been fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a new approach to multilabel classification, which is based on a framework that unifies instance-based learning and logistic regression, comprising both methods as special cases. This approach allows one to capture interdependencies between labels and, moreover, to combine model-based and similarity-based inference for multilabel classification. As will be shown by experimental studies, our approach is able to improve predictive accuracy in terms of several evaluation criteria for multilabel prediction.},

  abstract = {Physical expansion associated with the opening of a tension-sensitive channel has the same meaning as gating charge for a voltage-gated channel. Despite increasing evidence for the open-state conformation of MscL, the energetic description of its complex gating remains incomplete. The previously estimated in-plane expansion of MscL is considerably smaller than predicted by molecular models. To resolve this discrepancy, we conducted a systematic study of currents and dose-response curves for wild-type MscL in \emph{Escherichia coli} giant spheroplasts. Using the all-point histogram method and calibrating tension against the threshold for the small mechanosensitive channel (MscS) in each patch, we found that the distribution of channels among the subconducting states is significantly less dependent on tension than the distribution between the closed and conducting states. At -20 mV, all substates together occupy approximately 30\% of the open time and reduce the mean integral current by approximately 6\%, essentially independent of tension or P(o). This is consistent with the gating scheme in which the major rate-limiting step is the transition between the closed state and a low-conducting substate, and validates both the use of the integral current as a measure of P(o), and treatment of dose-response curves in the two-state approximation. The apparent energy and area differences between the states deltaE and deltaA, extracted from 29 independent dose-response curves, varied in a linearly correlated manner whereas the midpoint tension stayed at approximately 10.4 mN/m. Statistical modeling suggests slight variability of gating parameters among channels in each patch, causing a strong reduction and correlated spread of apparent deltaE and deltaA. The slope of initial parts of activation curves, with a few channels being active, gave estimates of deltaE = 51 +/- 13 kT and deltaA = 20.4 +/- 4.8 nm(2), the latter being consistent with structural models of MscL, which predict deltaA = 23 nm(2).},

We generated combinations of beneficial mutations that arose in a lineage during rapid adaptation of a bacterium whose growth depended on a newly introduced metabolic pathway. The proportional selective benefit for three of the four loci consistently decreased when they were introduced onto more fit backgrounds. These three alleles all reduced morphological defects caused by expression of the foreign pathway. A simple theoretical model segregating the apparent contribution of individual alleles to benefits and costs effectively predicted the interactions between them. These results provide the first evidence that patterns of epistasis may differ for within- and between-gene interactions during adaptation and that diminishing returns epistasis contributes to the consistent observation of decelerating fitness gains during adaptation.
Interactions between genes reduce the benefits of a mutation and decrease the rate of fitness gain during adaptation.

  abstract = {Rapid changes in extracellular osmolarity are one of many insults microbial cells face on a daily basis. To protect against such shocks, Escherichia coli and other microbes express several types of transmembrane channels that open and close in response to changes in membrane tension. In E. coli, one of the most abundant channels is the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL). While this channel has been heavily characterized through structural methods, electrophysiology, and theoretical modeling, our understanding of its physiological role in preventing cell death by alleviating high membrane tension remains tenuous. In this work, we examine the contribution of MscL alone to cell survival after osmotic shock at single-cell resolution using quantitative fluorescence microscopy. We conducted these experiments in an E. coli strain which is lacking all mechanosensitive channel genes save for MscL, whose expression was tuned across 3 orders of magnitude through modifications of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. While theoretical models suggest that only a few MscL channels would be needed to alleviate even large changes in osmotic pressure, we find that between 500 and 700 channels per cell are needed to convey upwards of 80\% survival. This number agrees with the average MscL copy number measured in wild-type E. coli cells through proteomic studies and quantitative Western blotting. Furthermore, we observed zero survival events in cells with fewer than œ≥100 channels per cell. This work opens new questions concerning the contribution of other mechanosensitive channels to survival, as well as regulation of their activity.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The intimate relationship between the environment and cellular growth rate has remained a major topic of inquiry in bacterial physiology for over a century. Now, as it becomes possible to understand how the growth rate dictates the wholesale reorganization of the intracellular molecular composition, we can interrogate the biophysical principles underlying this adaptive response. Regulation of gene expression drives this adaptation, with changes in growth rate tied to the activation or repression of genes covering enormous swaths of the genome. Here, we dissect how physiological perturbations alter the expression of a circuit which has been extensively characterized in a single physiological state. Given a complete thermodynamic model, we map changes in physiology directly to the biophysical parameters which define the expression. Controlling the growth rate via modulating the available carbon source or growth temperature, we measure the level of gene expression from a LacI-regulated promoter where the LacI copy number is directly measured in each condition, permitting parameter-free prediction of the expression level. The transcriptional output of this circuit is remarkably robust, with expression of the repressor being largely insensitive to the growth rate. The predicted gene expression quantitatively captures the observations under different carbon conditions, indicating that the biophysical parameters are indifferent to the physiology.

This debate is especially pertinent to microbial communities, which play crucial roles in areas such as health, disease, industry, and the environment. Here, we created a synthetic microbial community using heritable genetic barcodes and tracked community composition over repeated rounds of subculture with immigration. Consistent with theory, we find a transition exists between neutral and selective regimes, and the crossover point depends on the fraction of immigrants and the magnitude of fitness differences. Neutral models predict an increase in diversity with increased carrying capacity, while our selective model predicts a decrease in diversity. The community here lost diversity with an increase in carrying capacity, highlighting that using the correct model is essential for predicting community response to change. Together, these results emphasize the importance of including selection to obtain realistic models of even simple systems.},

The highly conserved general architecture of this pathway consists of two modules which mediate signal transduction and adaptation. The signal transduction module detects and amplifies changes in environmental conditions and rapidly transmits these signals to control bacterial swimming behavior. The adaptation module gradually resets the activity and sensitivity of the first module after initial stimulation and thereby enables the temporal comparisons necessary for bacterial chemotaxis. Recent experimental and theoretical work has unraveled multiple quantitative features emerging from the interplay between these two modules. This has laid the groundwork for rationalization of these emerging properties in the context of the evolutionary optimization of the chemotactic behavior.},

Theoretical analysis, based on the statistical thermodynamics of ligand binding, shows that cooperative interaction free energies amounting to several kJ {$\cdot$} mol-1 may be generated by this means. The effect arises out of the possible changes in frequencies and amplitudes of macromolecular thermal fluctuations in response to ligand attachment, and can involve all forms of dynamic behaviour, ranging from highly correlated, low-frequency normal mode vibrations to random local anharmonic motions of individual atoms or groups. Dynamic allostery of this form is primarily an entropy effect, and we derive approximate expressions which might allow the magnitude of the interaction in real systems to be calculated directly from experimental observations such as changes in normal mode frequencies and mean-square atomic displacements. Long-range influence of kinetic processes at different sites might also be mediated by a similar mechanism. We suggest that proteins and other biological macromolecules may have evolved to take functional advantage not only of mean conformational states but also of the inevitable thermal fluctuations about the mean.},

The mutant lacking ubiquinone, strain AN59 (Ubi-), when grown under aerobic conditions, gave an anaerobic type of growth yield and produced large quantities of lactic acid, indicating that ubiquinone plays a vital role in electron transport. 3. NADH and lactate oxidase activities in membranes from strain AN59 (Ubi-) were greatly impaired and activity was restored by the addition of ubiquinone (Q-1). 4. Comparison of the percentage reduction of flavin, cytochrome b1 and cytochrome a2 in the aerobic steady state in membranes from the normal strain (AN62) and strain AN59 (Ubi-) and the effect of respiratory inhibitors on these percentages in membranes from strain AN62 suggest that ubiquinone functions at more than one site in the electron-transport chain. 5. Membranes from strain AN62, in the absence of substrate, showed an electron-spin-resonance signal attributed to ubisemiquinone. The amount of reduced ubiquinone (50\%) found after rapid solvent extraction is consistent with the existence of ubiquinone in membranes as a stabilized ubisemiquinone. 6. The effects of piericidin A on membranes from strain AN62 suggest that this inhibitor acts at the ubiquinone sites: thus inhibition of electron transport is reversed by ubiquinone (Q-1); the aerobic steady-state oxidation\textendash reduction levels of flavins and cytochrome b1 in the presence of the inhibitor are raised to values approximating those found in the membranes of strain AN59 (Ubi-); the inhibitor rapidly eliminates the electron-spin-resonance signal attributed to ubisemiquinone and allows slow oxidation of endogenous ubiquinol in the absence of substrate and prevents reduction of ubiquinone in the presence of substrate. It is concluded that piericidin A separates ubiquinone from the remainder of the electron-transport chain. 7. A scheme is proposed in which ubisemiquinone, complexed to an electron carrier, functions in at least two positions in the electron-transport sequence.},

In this situation, we consider the effects of fluctuations stemming from a finite population size. We show that they unavoidably lead to extinction of two strategies in the population. However, the typical time until extinction occurs strongly prolongs with increasing system size. In the emerging time window, a quasi-stationary probability distribution forms that is anomalously flat in the vicinity of the coexistence state. This behavior originates in a vanishing linear deterministic drift near the fixed point. We provide numerical data as well as an analytical approach to the mean extinction time and the quasi-stationary probability distribution.},

Selection by individuals' fitness, usually the basic driving force of evolution, quickly eliminates cooperators. However, evolution is also governed by fluctuations that can be of greater importance than fitness differences, and can render evolution effectively neutral. Here, we investigate the effects of selection versus fluctuations in social dilemmas.By studying the mean extinction times of cooperators and defectors, a variable sensitive to fluctuations, we are able to identify and quantify an emerging `edge of neutral evolution' that delineates regimes of neutral and Darwinian evolution. Our results reveal that cooperation is significantly maintained in the neutral regimes. In contrast, the classical predictions of evolutionary game theory, where defectors beat cooperators, are recovered in the Darwinian regimes. Our studies demonstrate that fluctuations can provide a surprisingly simple way to partly resolve social dilemmas. Our methods are generally applicable to estimate the role of random drift in evolutionary dynamics.},

In contrast to the common assumption of an independent population size, evolution can be strongly affected by population dynamics in general. Especially for fast reproducing microbes which are subject to selection, both types of dynamics are often closely intertwined. We illustrate this by considering different growth scenarios. Depending on whether microbes die or stop to reproduce (dormancy), qualitatively different behaviors emerge. For cooperating bacteria, a permanent increase of costly cooperation can occur. Even if not permanent, cooperation can still increase transiently due to demographic fluctuations. We validate our analysis via stochastic simulations and analytic calculations. In particular, we derive a condition for an increase in the level of cooperation.},

Following recent experiments, we consider the role of population growth and the repetitive fragmentation of populations into new colonies mimicking simple microbial life-cycles. Individual-based modeling reveals that demographic fluctuations, which lead to a large variance in the composition of colonies, promote cooperation. Biased by population dynamics these fluctuations result in two qualitatively distinct regimes of robust cooperation under repetitive fragmentation into groups. First, if the level of cooperation exceeds a threshold, cooperators will take over the whole population. Second, cooperators can also emerge from a single mutant leading to a robust coexistence between cooperators and free-riders. We find frequency and size of population bottlenecks, and growth dynamics to be the major ecological factors determining the regimes and thereby the evolutionary pathway towards cooperation.},

Mechanistically, our model shows that local pH values in the lumen, which differentially affect the growth of different bacteria, drive changes in microbiota composition. It identifies key factors influencing the delicate regulation of colonic pH, including epithelial water absorption, nutrient inflow, and luminal buffering capacity, and generates testable predictions on their effects. Our findings show that a predictive and mechanistic understanding of microbial ecology in the gut is possible.

This review article discusses cooperative behavior in the microbial world, mediated by the exchange of extracellular products called public goods. We focus on model species for which the production of a public good and the related growth disadvantage for the producing cells are well described. To unveil the biological and ecological factors promoting the emergence and stability of cooperative traits we take an interdisciplinary perspective and review insights gained from both mathematical models and well-controlled experimental model systems. Ecologically, we include crucial aspects of the microbial life cycle into our analysis and particularly consider population structures where an ensemble of local communities (sub populations) continuously emerge, grow, and disappear again. Biologically, we explicitly consider the synthesis and regulation of public good production. The discussion of the theoretical approaches includes general evolutionary concepts, population dynamics, and evolutionary game theory. As a specific but generic biological example we consider populations of Pseudomonas putida and its regulation and utilization of pyoverdines, iron scavenging molecules. The review closes with an overview on cooperation in spatially extended systems and also provides a critical assessment of the insights gained from the experimental and theoretical studies discussed. Current challenges and important new research opportunities are discussed, including the biochemical regulation of public goods, more realistic ecological scenarios resembling native environments, cell to cell signalling, and multi-species communities.},

Based on the MscL conductance of 3.8 nS, and assumed pore lengths, a channel diameter of 34 to 46 A was calculated. To estimate the pore size experimentally, the effect of large organic ions on the conductance of MscL was examined. Poly-L-lysines (PLLs) with a diameter of 37 A or larger significantly reduced channel conductance, whereas spermine (approximately 15 A), PLL19 (approximately 25 A) and 1,1'-bis-(3-(1'-methyl-(4,4'-bipyridinium)-1-yl)-propyl)-4,4'-b ipyridinium (approximately 30 A) had no effect. The smaller organic ions putrescine, cadaverine, spermine, and succinate all permeated the channel. We conclude that the open pore diameter of the MscL is approximately 40 A, indicating that the MscL has one of the largest channel pores yet described. This channel diameter is consistent with the proposed homohexameric model of the MscL.},

For the last several decades, the lac operon has served as a valuable model for studying transcription. More recently, the switch that controls the operon has also been successfully adapted to function in mammalian cells. Here we describe how, using directed evolution, we have created a novel switch that recognizes an asymmetric operator sequence. The new switch has a repressor with altered headpiece domains for operator recognition and a redesigned dimer interface to create a heterodimeric repressor. Quite unexpectedly, the heterodimeric switch functions better than the natural system. It can repress more tightly than the naturally occurring switch of the lac operon; it is less leaky and can be induced more efficiently. Ultimately, these novel repressors could be evolved to recognize eukaryotic promoters and used to regulate gene expression in mammalian systems.},

The ability of point mutations to change multiple thermodynamic constants, and hence drastically alter the repressor's phenotype, shows how allosteric proteins can perform a wide array of similar yet distinct functions such as that exhibited in the Lac/Gal family of bacterial repressors.},

Here, we quantitatively characterize the translational capacity of Escherichia coli cells growing exponentially under hyperosmotic stress. We found that hyperosmotic stress affects bacterial protein synthesis through reduction of the translational elongation rate, which is largely compensated for by an increase in the cellular ribosome content compared with nutrient limitation at a similar growth rate. The slowdown of translational elongation is attributed to a reduction in the rate of binding of tRNA ternary complexes to the ribosomes.},

We found that this landscape is multipeaked, harboring in total 19 distinct optima. Analysis showed that all direct evolutionary pathways between peaks involve significant dips in the repression value. Consistent with earlier predictions, we found reciprocal sign epistatic interactions at the repression minimum of the most favorable paths between two peaks.

Purified EF-Tu enhanced the amount of MreB filaments, as seen by sedimentation assays, the speed of filament formation and the length of MreB filaments in vitro. EF-Tu had the strongest impact on MreB filaments in a 1:1 ratio, and EF-Tu co-sedimented with MreB filaments, revealing a stoichiometric interaction between both proteins. This was supported by cross-linking assays where 1:1 species were well detectable. When expressed in E. coli cells, B. subtilis MreB formed filaments and induced the formation of co-localizing B. subtilis EF-Tu structures, indicating that MreB can direct the positioning of EF-Tu structures in a heterologous cell system. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis showed that MreB filaments have a higher turnover in B. subtilis cells than in E. coli cells, indicating different filament kinetics in homologous or heterologous cell systems. The data show that MreB can direct the localization of EF-Tu in vivo, which in turn positively affects the formation and dynamics of MreB filaments.

To address this, we studied the lac system of \emph{Escherichia coli}, which allows the cell to use the sugar lactose for growth12. We experimentally measured the growth burden13,14 due to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a solution of a cost\textendash benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by evolution to function optimally in new environments.},

                The first part of this review contains an overview of the various
contributions and models relating to the control of rRNA synthesis
reported over the last 45 years. The second part describes a systems
biology approach to identify the factors and effectors that control the
interactions between RNA polymerase and rRNA (
                rrn

of
                Escherichia coli
                bacteria during exponential growth in
different media. This analysis is based on measurements of absolute
                rrn
                promoter activities as transcripts per minute per promoter
in bacterial strains either deficient or proficient in the synthesis of
the factor Fis and/or the effector ppGpp. These absolute promoter
activities are evaluated in terms of
                rrn
                promoter strength
(
                V
                max

                  m
                
                ) and free RNA
polymerase concentrations. Three major conclusions emerge from this
evaluation. First, the
                rrn
                promoters are not saturated with
RNA polymerase. As a consequence, changes in the concentration of free
RNA polymerase contribute to changes in
                rrn
                promoter
activities. Second,
                rrn
                P2 promoter strength is not
specifically regulated during exponential growth at different rates;
its activity changes only when the concentration of free RNA polymerase
changes. Third, the effector ppGpp reduces the strength of the
                rrn
                P1 promoter both directly and indirectly by reducing
synthesis of the stimulating factor Fis. This control of
                rrn
                P1 promoter strength forms part of a larger feedback loop that adjusts
the synthesis of ribosomes to the availability of amino acids via amino
acid-dependent control of ppGpp
accumulation.},

Studies have allowed us to determine the in vivo strength of promoters and have allowed us to distinguish between factor-dependent transcriptional control of the promoter and changes in promoter activity due to changes in the concentration of free functional RNA polymerase associated with different growth conditions. The total, or bulk, amounts of RNA and protein are linked to the growth rate, because most bacterial RNA is ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Since ribosomes are required for protein synthesis, their number and their rate of function determine the rate of protein synthesis and cytoplasmic mass accumulation. Many mRNAs made in the presence of amino acids have strong ribosome binding sites whose presence reduces the expression of all other active genes. This implies that there can be profound differences in the spectrum of gene activities in cultures grown in different media that produce the same growth rate. Five classes of growth-related parameters that are generally useful in describing or establishing the macromolecular composition of bacterial cultures are described in detail in this review. A number of equations have been reported that describe the macromolecular composition of an average cell in an exponential culture as a function of the culture doubling time and five additional parameters: the C- and D-periods, protein per origin (PO), ribosome activity, and peptide chain elongation rate.},

Introduction Understanding how bacteria harboring antibiotic resistance grow in the presence of antibiotics is critical for predicting the spread and evolution of drug resistance. Because drugs inhibit cell growth and a cell's growth state globally influences its gene expression, the expression of drug resistance is subject to an innate, growth-mediated feedback, leading to complex behaviors that affect both the characterization and the prevention of antibiotic resistance. We characterized the consequences of this feedback for the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

(A) This fitness landscape describes the fitness, or growth rates, of bacterial strains exposed to antibiotics (colored lines indicate the fitness of four example strains). Fitness drops abruptly at high drug concentrations. The shaded area shows a broad region of growth bistability, throughout which we observe that genetically identical cells possessing drug resistance are split into subpopulations of growing and nongrowing cells in response to antibiotics (B, top).
Methods We studied the growth of Escherichia coli strains expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics, by using both bulk and single-cell techniques. The growth of each strain was quantified in a broad range of drug concentrations by using time-lapse microscopy (to track the responses of individual cells to antibiotics inside a microfluidic chemostat) and by the enrichment of batch cultures for nongrowing cells. We formulated a quantitative phenomenological model to predict the growth rates of drug-resistant strains in the presence of drugs, based on the well-characterized biochemistry of drug and drug-resistance interactions and on bacterial growth laws that dictate relations between cell growth and gene expression. We tested the model predictions for various drugs and resistance mechanisms by constructing strains that constitutively express varying degrees of drug resistance.
Results In strains expressing a moderate degree of drug resistance, growth rates dropped abruptly above a critical drug concentration, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), whose value increased linearly with the basal level of resistance expression (see figure below, panel A). Cells exhibited growth bistability over a broad range of drug concentrations below the MIC: Isogenic cells expressing drug resistance coexisted in growing and nongrowing states in a homogeneous environment (panel B). Our model accurately predicted the range of drug concentrations in which growth bistability occurred, as well as the growth rates of the growing subpopulation, without any ad hoc fitting parameters. These findings reveal a plateau-like fitness landscape (panel A), which can be used to study the evolution of drug resistance in environments with varying drug concentrations.
Discussion The broad occurrence of growth bistability in drug-resistant bacteria challenges the common notions and measures of drug efficacy and resistance. And because growth bistability can arise without complex regulation when gene expression is coupled to the state of cell growth, similar physiological links may underlie the growth bistability implicated in causing bacterial persistence. The availability of quantitative, predictive models will facilitate the formulation of strategies to limit the efficacy and evolvability of drug resistance.
Keeping Quiet
Many bacteria overcome antibiotic treatment by expressing proteins that confer antibiotic resistance, for instance, efflux pumps. But when a strain that expresses these antibiotic resistance proteins encounters an environment containing the corresponding drug, the resistance against the drug may paradoxically become silenced in many cells. In this case, a fraction of a population of genetically identical cells will grow in the presence of antibiotics while other subpopulations fail to grow at all. Deris et al. (10.1126/science.1237435) show that this bistable response arises from a built-in global feedback originating in antibiotic-mediated inhibition of growth, which reduces the expression of proteins that protect against growth inhibition. The resulting populations of dormant cells can exceed 50\%, among otherwise identical resistance-expressing cells. This is important for antimicrobial treatment strategies because many bacterial cells may remain vulnerable to an antibiotic even when they apparently display strong resistance to it.
To predict the emergence of antibiotic resistance, quantitative relations must be established between the fitness of drug-resistant organisms and the molecular mechanisms conferring resistance. These relations are often unknown and may depend on the state of bacterial growth. To bridge this gap, we have investigated Escherichia coli strains expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics. We show that resistance expression and drug inhibition are linked in a positive feedback loop arising from an innate, global effect of drug-inhibited growth on gene expression. A quantitative model of bacterial growth based on this innate feedback accurately predicts the rich phenomena observed: a plateau-shaped fitness landscape, with an abrupt drop in the growth rates of cultures at a threshold drug concentration, and the coexistence of growing and nongrowing populations, that is, growth bistability, below the threshold.
Identical bacteria can have low-level resistance to low concentrations of drugs that can flip subpopulations into dormancy.

We sought to determine the contribution of geographic distance (as a proxy for dispersal limitation) and phenotypic traits (as a proxy for environmental sorting), including morphology, metabolic ability and interspecific competitiveness, to the genotypic diversity in a nectar yeast species, Metschnikowia reukaufii. To measure genotypic diversity, we sequenced the genomes of 102 strains of M. reukaufii isolated from the floral nectar of hummingbird-pollinated shrub, Mimulus aurantiacus, along a 200km coastline in California. Intraspecific genetic variation showed no detectable relationship with geographic distance, but could be grouped into three distinct lineages that correlated with metabolic ability and interspecific competitiveness. Despite ample evidence for strong competitive interactions within and among nectar yeasts, a full spectrum of the genotypic and phenotypic diversity observed across the 200km coastline was represented even at a scale as small as 200 m. Further, more competitive strains were not necessarily more abundant. These results suggest that dispersal limitation and environmental sorting might not fully explain intraspecific diversity in this microbe and highlight the need to also consider other ecological factors such as trade-offs, source-sink dynamics and niche modification.},

  abstract = {We describe a method to detect molecular complexes and measure their stoichiometry in living cells from simultaneous fluctuations of the fluorescence intensity in two image channels, each detecting a different kind of protein. The number and brightness (N\&B) analysis, namely, the use of the ratio between the variance and the average intensity to obtain the brightness of molecules, is extended to the cross-variance of the intensity fluctuations in two channels. We apply the cross-variance method to determine the stoichiometry of complexes containing paxillin and vinculin or focal adhesion kinase (FAK) in disassembling adhesions in mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing FAK, vinculin, and paxillin-tagged with EGFP and mCherry. We found no complexes of these proteins in the cytoplasm away from the adhesions. However, at the adhesions, large aggregates leave, forming a hole, during their disassembly. This hole shows cross-correlation between FAK and paxillin and vinculin and paxillin. From the amplitude of the correlated fluctuations we determine the composition of the aggregates leaving the adhesions. These aggregates disassemble rapidly in the cytoplasm because large complexes are found only in very close proximity to the adhesions or at their borders.},

  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the Twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway secretes a set of folded proteins with important physiological functions to the periplasm and outer membrane. The loss of Tat secretion impairs outer membrane integrity and leads to decreased cell growth. Only recently, the Tat pathway has gained more attention due to its essential role in bacterial virulence and applications in the production of fully folded heterologous proteins. In this study, we investigated the influence of the deletion of all active Tat pathway components on the E. coli cells. The comprehensive proteomic analysis revealed activation of several stress responses and experimentally confirmed the dependence of certain proteins on the Tat system for export. We observed that a tat deletion triggers protein aggregation, membrane vesiculation, synthesis of colanic acid and biofilm formation. Furthermore, the mislocalization of Tat-dependent proteins disturbs iron and molybdenum homeostasis and impairs the cell envelope integrity. The results show that the functional Tat pathway is important for the physiological stability and that its dysfunction leads to a series of severe changes in E. coli cells.},

Using tethered particle motion in a temperature-controlled sample chamber, we systematically investigated the effect of increasing temperature on DNA structure and the interplay between this effect and protein binding. Our measurements revealed that (1) increasing temperature enhances DNA flexibility, effectively leading to more compact folding of the double-stranded DNA chain, and (2) temperature differentially affects different types of DNA-bending chromatin proteins from mesophilic and thermophilic organisms. Thus, our findings aid in understanding genome organization in organisms thriving at moderate as well as extreme temperatures. Moreover, our results underscore the importance of carefully controlling and measuring temperature in single-molecule DNA (micromanipulation) experiments.},

The association rate is decreased from 4.6 x 10(4) M-1S-1 to 1.0 x 10(4) M-1S-1 by the presence of saturating amounts of operator DNA fragments. The inducer dissociation rate was measured by dilution of repressor . operator . inducer complexes and by displacement of the sugar molecule from repressor by the binding of operator DNA. The value for the dissociation rate in the presence of bound DNA was 0.8 S-1; this is 4-fold greater than the inducer dissociation rate measured in the absence of operator. These kinetic results suggest that repressor should exhibit a 20-fold lower affinity for inducer when operator DNA fragments are bound; this prediction is in agreement with previous equilibrium measurements. Measurement of the rate of operator fragment dissociation from repressor using a nitrocellulose filter assay yields a value of 0.04 S-1 in the absence of inducer; this dissociation rate is too rapid to measure in the presence of bound inducer molecules. Calculations assuming that the DNA-protein association rate is unaffected by sugar binding suggest that the rate of dissociation of DNA from repressor containing 4 bound inducer molecules may be as high as 40 S-1. Determination of the apparent association rate for inducer binding to operator DNA fragments indicates that DNA molecules do dissociate from the protein . operator . inducer complex at intermediate stages during the sugar binding reaction. The exact point at which dissociation occurs at a complex function of the concentrations of operator and inducer and the relationship between the rates for sugar binding and for operator fragment dissociation which are comparable for some of the protein species.},

Here we systematically tested the predictive power of models of DNA accessibility based on the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allostery, which posits that chromatin fluctuates between accessible and inaccessible states. We dissected the regulatory dynamics of \emph{hunchback} by the activator Bicoid and the pioneer-like transcription factor Zelda in living \emph{Drosophila} embryos and showed that no thermodynamic or non-equilibrium MWC model can recapitulate \emph{hunchback} transcription. Therefore, we explored a model where DNA accessibility is not the result of thermal fluctuations but is catalyzed by Bicoid and Zelda, possibly through histone acetylation, and found that this model can predict \emph{hunchback} dynamics. Thus, our theory-experiment dialogue uncovered potential molecular mechanisms of transcriptional regulatory dynamics, a key step toward reaching a predictive understanding of developmental decision-making.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Mechanosensitive channels sense elevated membrane tension that arises from rapid water influx occurring when cells move from high to low osmolarity environments (hypoosmotic shock). These non-specific channels in the cytoplasmic membrane release osmotically-active solutes and ions. The two major mechanosensitive channels in \emph{Escherichia coli} are MscL and MscS. Deletion of both proteins severely compromises survival of hypoosmotic shock. However, like many bacteria, \emph{E. coli} cells possess other MscS-type genes (kefA, ybdG, ybiO, yjeP and ynaI). Two homologs, MscK (kefA) and YbdG, have been characterized as mechanosensitive channels that play minor roles in maintaining cell integrity. Additional channel openings are occasionally observed in patches derived from mutants lacking MscS, MscK and MscL. Due to their rare occurrence, little is known about these extra pressure-induced currents or their genetic origins. Here we complete the identification of the remaining \emph{E. coli} mechanosensitive channels YnaI, YbiO and YjeP. The latter is the major component of the previously described MscM activity (\textasciitilde 300 pS), while YnaI (\textasciitilde 100 pS) and YbiO (\textasciitilde 1000 pS) were previously unknown. Expression of native YbiO is NaCl-specific and RpoS-dependent. A Delta7 strain was created with all seven \emph{E. coli} mechanosensitive channel genes deleted. High level expression of YnaI, YbiO or YjeP proteins from a multicopy plasmid in the Delta7 strain (MJFGH) leads to substantial protection against hypoosmotic shock. Purified homologs exhibit high molecular masses that are consistent with heptameric assemblies. This work reveals novel mechanosensitive channels and discusses the regulation of their expression in the context of possible additional functions.},

Noise is something of a nuisance when it comes to developing reliable genetic circuits, and various control circuits have evolved to cope with it. But a new wave of studies is showing that noise can, and does, provide vital functions that would be difficult or impossible to achieve in 'noiseless' gene circuits. In this Review, Avigdor Eldar and Michael Elowitz discuss the emerging principles that connect noise, the architecture of gene circuits in which it appears, and the biological functions that it enables.},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of \emph{Escherichia coli} that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise.

This protocol is based on the use of type IIs restriction enzymes and is performed by simply subjecting a mix of 10 undigested input plasmids (nine insert plasmids and the acceptor vector) to a restriction-ligation and transforming the resulting mix in competent cells. The efficiency of this protocol allows generating libraries of recombinant genes by combining in one reaction several fragment sets prepared from different parental templates. As an example, we have applied this strategy for shuffling of trypsinogen from three parental templates (bovine cationic trypsinogen, bovine anionic trypsinogen and human cationic trypsinogen) each divided in 9 separate modules. We show that one round of shuffling using the 27 trypsinogen entry plasmids can easily produce the 19,683 different possible combinations in one single restriction-ligation and that expression screening of a subset of the library allows identification of variants that can lead to higher expression levels of trypsin activity. This protocol, that we call `Golden Gate shuffling', is robust, simple and efficient, can be performed with templates that have no homology, and can be combined with other shuffling protocols in order to introduce any variation in any part of a given gene.},

Changes in the nutrient environment have long been used to study regulation and adaptation phenomena in microorganisms1,2,3 and they remain a topic of active investigation4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Although much is known about the molecular interactions that govern the regulation of key metabolic processes in response to applied perturbations12,13,14,15,16,17, they are insufficiently quantified for predictive bottom-up modelling. Here we develop a top-down approach, expanding the recently established coarse-grained proteome allocation models15,18,19,20 from steady-state growth into the kinetic regime. Using only qualitative knowledge of the underlying regulatory processes and imposing the condition of flux balance, we derive a quantitative model of bacterial growth transitions that is independent of inaccessible kinetic parameters. The resulting flux-controlled regulation model accurately predicts the time course of gene expression and biomass accumulation in response to carbon upshifts and downshifts (for example, diauxic shifts) without adjustable parameters. As predicted by the model and validated by quantitative proteomics, cells exhibit suboptimal recovery kinetics in response to nutrient shifts owing to a rigid strategy of protein synthesis allocation, which is not directed towards alleviating specific metabolic bottlenecks. Our approach does not rely on kinetic parameters, and therefore points to a theoretical framework for describing a broad range of such kinetic processes without detailed knowledge of the underlying biochemical reactions.},

  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, the phosphoenolpyruvate\textendash carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) is responsible for the transport and phosphorylation of sugars, such as glucose. PTS activity has a crucial role in the global signaling system that controls the preferential consumption of glucose over other carbon sources. When the cell is exposed to carbohydrate mixtures, the PTS prevents the expression of catabolic genes and activity of non-PTS sugars transport systems by carbon catabolite repression (CCR). This process defines some metabolic and physiological constraints that must be considered during the development of production strains. In this review, we summarize the importance of the PTS in controlling and influencing both PTS and non-PTS sugar transport processes as well as the mechanisms of transcriptional control involved in the expression of catabolic genes of non-PTS sugars in E. coli. We discuss three main approaches applied efficiently to avoid these constraints resulting in obtaining PTS- glc+ mutants useful for production purposes: (1) adaptive selection in chemostat culture system of PTS- mutants, resulting in the selection of strains that recovered the ability to grow in glucose, along with the simultaneous consumption of two carbon sources and reduced acetate production; (2) replacement in PTS- strains of the native GalP promoter by strong promoters or the substitution of this permease by recombinant glucose transport system; and (3) enhancement of Crp (crp+) in mgsA, pgi, and ptsG mutants, resulting in derivative strains that abolished CCR, allowing the simultaneous consumption of mixtures of sugars with low acetate production.},

  abstract = {The high environmental costs of raising livestock are now widely appreciated, yet consumption of animal-based food items continues and is expanding throughout the world. Consumers' ability to distinguish among, and rank, various interchangeable animal-based items is crucial to reducing environmental costs of diets. However, the individual environmental burdens exerted by the five dominant livestock categories \textendash{} beef, dairy, poultry, pork and eggs \textendash{} are not fully known. Quantifying those burdens requires splitting livestock`s relatively well-known total environmental costs (e.g. land and fertilizer use for feed production) into partial categorical costs. Because such partitioning quantifies the relative environmental desirability of various animal-based food items, it is essential for environmental impact minimization efforts to be made. Yet to date, no such partitioning method exists. The present paper presents such a partitioning method for feed production-related environmental burdens. This approach treated each of the main feed classes individually \textendash{} concentrates (grain, soy, by-products; supporting production of all livestock), processed roughage (mostly hay and silage) and pasture \textendash{} which is key given these classes' widely disparate environmental costs. It was found that for the current US food system and national diet, concentrates are partitioned as follows: beef 0{$\cdot$}21{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}112, poultry 0{$\cdot$}27{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}046, dairy 0{$\cdot$}24{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}041, pork 0{$\cdot$}23{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}093 and eggs 0{$\cdot$}04{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}018. Pasture and processed roughage, consumed only by cattle, are 0{$\cdot$}92{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}034 and 0{$\cdot$}87{$\pm$}0{$\cdot$}031 due to beef, with the remainder due to dairy. In a follow-up paper, the devised methodology will be employed to partition total land, irrigated water, greenhouse gases and reactive nitrogen burdens incurred by feed production among the five edible livestock categories.},

In the United States, beef production is the main agricultural resource user overall, as well as per kcal or g of protein. Here, we offer a possible, non-unique, definition of `sustainable' beef as that subsisting exclusively on grass and by-products, and quantify its expected US production as a function of pastureland use. Assuming today's pastureland characteristics, all of the pastureland that US beef currently use can sustainably deliver {$\approx$}45\% of current production. Rewilding this pastureland's less productive half ({$\approx$}135 million ha) can still deliver {$\approx$}43\% of current beef production. In all considered scenarios, the {$\approx$}32 million ha of high-quality cropland that beef currently use are reallocated for plant-based food production. These plant items deliver 2- to 20-fold more calories and protein than the replaced beef and increase the delivery of protective nutrients, but deliver no B12. Increased deployment of rapid rotational grazing or grassland multi-purposing may increase beef production capacity.},

We show that this bacterial paradigm cannot explain the sharp expression of a canonical developmental gene in response to a regulating transcription factor (TF). In the absence of energy expenditure, with regulatory DNA at thermodynamic equilibrium, information integration across multiple TF binding sites can generate the required sharpness, but with strong constraints on the resultant ``higher-order cooperativities.'' Even with such integration, there is a ``Hopfield barrier'' to sharpness; for n TF binding sites, this barrier is represented by the Hill function with the Hill coefficient n. If, however, energy is expended to maintain regulatory DNA away from thermodynamic equilibrium, as in kinetic proofreading, this barrier can be breached and greater sharpness achieved. Our approach is grounded in fundamental physics, leads to testable experimental predictions, and suggests how a quantitative paradigm for eukaryotic gene regulation can be formulated.},

Here we use an individual-based simulation model of microbial biofilms to investigate how competitive and mutualistic interactions between an antibiotic-resistant and a susceptible strain (or species) influence the two-lineage community response to antibiotic exposure. Our model predicts that while increasing competition and antibiotics leads to increasing competitive release of the antibiotic-resistant strain, hitting a mutualistic community of cross-feeding species with antibiotics leads to a mutualistic suppression effect where both susceptible and resistant species are harmed. We next show that the impact of antibiotics is further governed by emergent spatial feedbacks within communities. Mutualistic cross-feeding communities can rescue susceptible members by subsidizing their growth inside the biofilm despite lack of access to the nutrient-rich and high-antibiotic growing front. Moreover, we show that antibiotic detoxification by resistant cells can protect nearby susceptible cells, but such cross-protection is more effective in mutualistic communities because mutualism drives mixing of resistant and susceptible cells. In contrast, competition leads to segregation, which ultimately prevents susceptible cells to profit from detoxification. Understanding how the interplay between microbial metabolic interactions and community spatial structuring shapes the outcome of antibiotic treatment can be key to effectively leverage the power of antibiotics and promote microbiome health.},

It increases emission of nitrous oxide, which contributes 6.2\%, while carbon dioxide and methane contribute 76\% and 16\%, respectively of the global warming. However, N causes cooling due to emission of NOx, which alters concentrations of tropospheric ozone and methane. NOx and NH3 also form aerosols with considerable cooling effects. We studied global temperature change potential (GTP) of N use in agriculture. The GTP due to N2O was 396.67 and 1168.32 Tg CO2e on a 20-year (GTP20) and 439.94 and 1295.78 Tg CO2e on 100-year scale (GTP100) during years 1961 and 2010, respectively. Cooling effects due to N use were 92.14 and 271.39 Tg CO2e (GTP20) and 15.21 and 44.80 Tg CO2e (GTP100) during 1961 and 2010, respectively.

Thus net GTP20 is lower by 6.9\% and GTP100 by 2.4\% compared to the GTP considering N2O emission alone. The study shows that both warming and cooling effects should be considered to estimate the GTP of N use.},

  abstract = {Crystallization of the mutated hemoglobin, HbC, which occurs inside red blood cells of patients expressing {$\beta$}C-globin and exhibiting the homozygous CC and the heterozygous SC (in which two mutant {$\beta$}-globins, S and C, are expressed) diseases, is a convenient model for processes underlying numerous condensation diseases. As a first step, we investigated the molecular-level mechanisms of crystallization of this protein from high-concentration phosphate buffer in its stable carbomonoxy form using high-resolution atomic force microscopy. We found that in conditions of equilibrium with the solution, the crystals' surface reconstructs into four-molecule-wide strands along the crystallographic a (or b) axis. However, the crystals do not grow by the alignment of such preformed strands. We found that the crystals grow by the attachment of single molecules to suitable sites on the surface. These sites are located along the edges of new layers generated by two-dimensional nucleation or by screw dislocations. During growth, the steps propagate with random velocities, with the mean being an increasing function of the crystallization driving force. These results show that the crystallization mechanisms of HbC are similar to those found for other proteins. Therefore, strategies developed to control protein crystallization in vitro may be applicable to pathology-related crystallization systems.},

However, the role of the lactose permease, encoded by the lacY gene, when using the gratuitous inducer IPTG for the overexpression of heterologous proteins, is still a matter of discussion. A lactose permease deficient strain was successfully constructed. Growing profiles and acetate production were compared with its parent strain at shake flask scale. Our results show that the lac-permease deficient strain grows slower than the parent in defined medium at shake flask scale, probably due to a downregulation of the phosphotransferase system (PTS). The distributions of IPTG in the medium and inside the cells, as well as recombinant protein production were measured by HPLC\textendash MS and compared in substrate limiting fed-batch fermentations at different inducer concentrations. For the mutant strain, IPTG concentration in the medium depletes slower, reaching at the end of the culture higher concentration values compared with the parent strain. Final intracellular and medium concentrations of IPTG were similar for the mutant strain, while higher intracellular concentrations than in medium were found for the parent strain. Comparison of the distribution profiles of IPTG of both strains in fed-batch fermentations showed that lac-permease is crucially involved in IPTG uptake. In the absence of the transporter, apparently IPTG only diffuses, while in the presence of lac-permease, the inducer accumulates in the cytoplasm at higher rates emphasizing the significant contribution of the permease-mediated transport.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic genomes contain thousands of genes organized into complex and interconnected genetic interaction networks. Most of our understanding of how genetic variation affects these networks comes from quantitative-trait loci mapping and from the systematic analysis of double-deletion (or knockdown) mutants, primarily in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Evolve and re-sequence experiments are an alternative approach for identifying novel functional variants and genetic interactions, particularly between non-loss-of-function mutations. These experiments leverage natural selection to obtain genotypes with functionally important variants and positive genetic interactions. However, no systematic methods for detecting genetic interactions in these data are yet available. Here, we introduce a computational method based on the idea that variants in genes that interact will co-occur in evolved genotypes more often than expected by chance. We apply this method to a previously published yeast experimental evolution dataset. We find that genetic targets of selection are distributed non-uniformly among evolved genotypes, indicating that genetic interactions had a significant effect on evolutionary trajectories. We identify individual gene pairs with a statistically significant genetic interaction score. The strongest interaction is between genes TRK1 and PHO84, genes that have not been reported to interact in previous systematic studies. Our work demonstrates that leveraging parallelism in experimental evolution is useful for identifying genetic interactions that have escaped detection by other methods.This article is part of the theme issue `Convergent evolution in the genomics era: new insights and directions'.},

  abstract = {It is generally accepted that the translation rate depends on the availability of cognate aa-tRNAs. In this study it is shown that the key factor that determines translation rate is the competition between near-cognate and cognate aa-tRNAs. The transport mechanism in the cytoplasm is diffusion, thus the competition between cognate, near-cognate and non-cognate aa-tRNAs to bind to the ribosome is a stochastic process. Two competition measures are introduced; C(i) and R(i) (i = 1, 64) are quotients of the arrival frequencies of near-cognates vs. cognates and noncognates vs. cognates, respectively. Furthermore, the reaction rates of bound cognates differ from those of bound near-cognates. If a near-cognate aa-tRNA binds to the A site of the ribosome, it may be rejected at the anti-codon recognition step or proofreading step or it may be accepted. Regardless of its fate, the near-cognates and non-cognates have caused delays of varying duration to the observed rate of translation. Rate constants have been measured at a temperature of 20 \textdegree C by (Gromadski, K.B., Rodnina, M.V., 2004. Kinetic determinants of high-fidelity tRNA discrimination on the ribosome. Mol. Cell 13, 191\textendash 200). These rate constants have been re-evaluated at 37 \textdegree C, using experimental data at 24.5 \textdegree C and 37 \textdegree C (Varenne, S., et al., 1984. Translation in a non-uniform process: effect of tRNA availability on the rate of elongation of nascent polypeptide chains. J. Mol. Biol. 180, 549\textendash 576). The key results of the study are: (i) the average time (at 37 \textdegree C) to add an amino acid, as defined by the ith codon, to the nascent peptide chain is: {$\tau$}(i) = 9.06 + 1.445 \texttimes{} [10.48C(i) + 0.5R(i)] (in ms); (ii) the misreading frequency is directly proportional to the near-cognate competition, E(i) = 0.0009C(i); (iii) the competition from near-cognates, and not the availability of cognate aa-tRNAs, is the most important factor that determines the translation rate \textendash{} the four codons with highest near-cognate competition (in the case of E. coli) are [GCC] {$>$} [CGG] {$>$} [AGG] {$>$} [GGA], which overlap only partially with the rarest codons: [AGG] {$<$} [CCA] {$<$} [GCC] {$<$} [CA C]; (iv) based on the kinetic rates at 37 \textdegree C, the average time to insert a cognate amino acid is 9.06 ms and the average delay to process a nearcognate aa-tRNA is 10.45 ms and (vii) the model also provides estimates of the vacancy times of the A site of the ribosome \textendash{} an important factor in frameshifting.},

For example, many chemical processes follow the S-shaped Hill equation relation between input concentrations and output concentrations. That Hill equation pattern contradicts the fundamental Michaelis-Menten theory of enzyme kinetics. I use the discrepancy between the expected Michaelis-Menten process of enzyme kinetics and the widely observed Hill equation pattern of biological systems to explore the general properties of biological input-output relations. I start with the various processes that could explain the discrepancy between basic chemistry and biological pattern. I then expand the analysis to consider broader aspects that shape biological input-output relations. Key aspects include the input-output processing by component subsystems and how those components combine to determine the system's overall input-output relations. That aggregate structure often imposes strong regularity on underlying disorder. Aggregation imposes order by dissipating information as it flows through the components of a system. The dissipation of information may be evaluated by the analysis of measurement and precision, explaining why certain common scaling patterns arise so frequently in input-output relations. I discuss how aggregation, measurement and scale provide a framework for understanding the relations between pattern and process. The regularity imposed by those broader structural aspects sets the contours of variation in biology. Thus, biological design will also tend to follow those contours. Natural selection may act primarily to modulate system properties within those broad constraints.},

In addition to the classic activation of the stringent response, it has become evident that (p)ppGpp exerts differential effects on cell physiology in an incremental manner rather than simply acting as a biphasic switch that controls growth or stasis. Of particular interest is the intimate relationship of (p)ppGpp with persister cell formation and virulence, which has spurred the pursuit of (p)ppGpp inhibitors as a means to control recalcitrant infections. Here, we present an overview of the enzymes responsible for (p)ppGpp metabolism, elaborate on the intricacies that link basal production of (p)ppGpp to bacterial homeostasis, and discuss the implications of targeting (p)ppGpp synthesis as a means to disrupt long-term bacterial survival strategies.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Mutant phenotype analysis of bacteria has been revolutionized by genome-scale screening procedures, but essential genes have been left out of such studies because mutants are missing from the libraries analyzed. Since essential genes control the most fundamental processes of bacterial life, this is a glaring deficiency. To address this limitation, we developed a procedure for transposon insertion mutant sequencing that includes essential genes. The method, called transformation transposon insertion mutant sequencing (TFNseq), employs saturation-level libraries of bacterial mutants generated by natural transformation with chromosomal DNA mutagenized heavily by in vitro transposition. The efficient mutagenesis makes it possible to detect large numbers of insertions in essential genes immediately after transformation and to follow their loss during subsequent growth. It was possible to order 45 essential processes based on how rapidly their inactivation inhibited growth. Inactivating ATP production, deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, or ribosome production blocked growth the fastest, whereas inactivating cell division or outer membrane protein synthesis blocked it the slowest. Individual mutants deleted of essential loci formed microcolonies of nongrowing cells whose sizes were generally consistent with the TFNseq ordering. The sensitivity of essential functions to genetic inactivation provides a metric for ranking their relative importance for bacterial replication and growth. Highly sensitive functions could represent attractive antibiotic targets since even partial inhibition should reduce growth.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

By performing limited proteolysis and separating the reaction products by size on a blue native PAGE gel, a ladder of reaction products corresponding to the number of subunits can be resolved. The pattern of bands may be used to distinguish the presence of a single homo-oligomer from a mixture of oligomeric states. We have applied OCAM to study the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) and find that these proteins can exist in multiple oligomeric states ranging from tetramers up to possible hexamers. Our results demonstrate the existence of oligomeric forms of MscL not yet observed by X-ray crystallography or other techniques and that in some cases a single type of MscL subunit can assemble as a mixture of oligomeric states.},

  abstract = {AIMS: The aim was to evaluate the biosynthetic requirements for the repair of sublethal membrane damages in \emph{Escherichia coli} cells after exposure to pulsed electric fields (PEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: The partial loss of the barrier and homeostatic functions of the cytoplasmic membrane was examined by adding sodium chloride to the recovery media. More than 4 log10 cycles of survivors were sublethally injured after PEF. Repair of such sublethal membrane damages occurred when survivors to PEF were incubated in peptone water for 2 h. Two different types of sublethally injured cells were detected. Whereas a small proportion ({$<$}5\%) repaired after PEF in less than 2 min, the repair of the remaining 95\% injured cells lasted 2 h and was dependent on biosynthetic requirements. The addition of inhibitors such as chloramphenicol, cerulenin, penicillin G, rifampicin and sodium azide to the liquid repair medium showed that the repair required energy and lipid synthesis, and was not dependent on protein, peptidoglican or RNA synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Cell survival after PEF is dependent on the repair of the cytoplasmic membrane. Requirement of lipid synthesis for the repair of sublethally injured cells confirms that the cytoplasmic membrane is a target directly involved in the mechanism of inactivation by PEF. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Knowledge about the damages inflicted by PEF might help in the design of more efficient treatments.},

  abstract = {Statistical mechanics is one of the most powerful and elegant tools in the quantitative sciences. One key virtue of statistical mechanics is that it is designed to examine large systems with many interacting degrees of freedom, providing a clue that it might have some bearing on the analysis of the molecules of living matter. As a result of data on biological systems becoming increasingly quantitative, there is a concomitant demand that the models set forth to describe biological systems be themselves quantitative. We describe how statistical mechanics is part of the quantitative toolkit that is needed to respond to such data. The power of statistical mechanics is not limited to traditional physical and chemical problems and there are a host of interesting ways in which these ideas can be applied in biology. This article reports on our efforts to teach statistical mechanics to life science students and provides a framework for others interested in bringing these tools to a nontraditional audience in the life sciences.},

These case studies include ligand-gated ion channels, thermodynamic models of transcription, and recent applications to the problem of bacterial chemotaxis. As part of the description of these case studies, we explore a number of different uses of the famed Monod\textendash Wyman\textendash Changeux (MWC) model as a generic tool for providing a mathematical characterization of two-state systems.

In this work, we test this idea by characterizing repression in vivo and the binding of RNA polymerase in vitro in experiments where operators of various sequences were placed either upstream or downstream from the promoter in Escherichia coli. Surprisingly, we find that operators with a weaker binding affinity can yield higher repression levels than stronger operators. Repressor bound to upstream operators modulates promoter escape, and the magnitude of this modulation is not correlated with the repressor-operator binding affinity. This suggests that operator sequences may modulate transcription by altering the nature of the interaction of the bound transcription factor with the transcriptional machinery, implying a new layer of sequence dependence that must be confronted in the quantitative understanding of gene expression.},

A tandem connection of two or more histidine-aspartate motifs forms complex phosphorelays. While response regulators from simple two-component systems have been characterized structurally in their inactive and active forms, we address here the question of whether a response regulator from a phosphorelay has a distinct structural basis of activation. We report the NMR solution structure of BeF3--activated Spo0F, the first structure of a response regulator from a phosphorelay in its activated state. Conformational changes were found in regions previously identified to change in simple two-component systems. In addition, a downward shift by half a helical turn in helix 1, located on the opposite side of the common activation surface, was observed as a consequence of BeF3- activation. Conformational changes in helix 1 can be rationalized by the distinct function of phosphoryl transfer to the second histidine kinase, Spo0B, because helix 1 is known to interact directly with Spo0B and the phosphatase RapB. The identification of structural rearrangements in Spo0F supports the hypothesis of a pre-existing equilibrium between the inactive and active state prior to phosphorylation that was suggested on the basis of previous NMR dynamics studies on Spo0F. A shift of a pre-existing equilibrium is likely a general feature of response regulators.},

To investigate this, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify transcript heterogeneity in single Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. Leveraging the extensive knowledge of yeast transcriptional regulation, we uncovered significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. We also discovered that a subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1, revealed both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.},

R1 binds NDPs and contains binding sites for allosteric effectors that control substrate specificity and turnover rate. R2 contains a diiron-tyrosyl radical (Y\textbullet ) cofactor that initiates nucleotide reduction. Pre-steady-state experiments with wild type R1 or C754S/C759S-R1 and R2 were carried out to determine which step(s) are rate-limiting and whether both active sites of R1 can catalyze nucleotide reduction. Rapid chemical quench experiments monitoring dCDP formation gave kobs of 9 ( 4 s-1 with an amplitude of 1.7 ( 0.4 equiv. This amplitude, generated in experiments with pre-reduced R1 (3 or 15 \textmu M) in the absence of reductant, indicates that both monomers of R1 are active. Stopped-flow UV-vis spectroscopy monitoring the concentration of the Y\textbullet{} failed to reveal any changes from 2 ms to seconds under similar conditions. These pre-steady-state experiments, in conjunction with the steady-state turnover numbers for dCDP formation of 2-14 s-1 at RNR concentrations of 0.05-0.4 \textmu M (typical assay conditions), reveal that the rate-determining step is a physical step prior to rapid nucleotide reduction and rapid tyrosine reoxidation to Y\textbullet. Steady-state experiments conducted at RNR concentrations of 3 and 15 \textmu M, typical of pre-steady-state conditions, suggest that, in addition to the slow conformational change(s) prior to chemistry, re-reduction of the active site disulfide to dithiol or a conformational change accompanying this process can also be ratelimiting.},

Here are a few holes in Bayesian data analysis: (1) the usual rules of conditional probability fail in the quantum realm, (2) flat or weak priors lead to terrible inferences about things we care about, (3) subjective priors are incoherent, (4) Bayes factors fail in the presence of flat or weak priors, (5) for Cantorian reasons we need to check our models, but this destroys the coherence of Bayesian inference. Some of the problems of Bayesian statistics arise from people trying to do things they should not be trying to do, but other holes are not so easily patched. In particular, it may be a good idea to avoid flat, weak, or conventional priors, but such advice, if followed, would go against the vast majority of Bayesian practice and requires us to confront the fundamental incoherence of Bayesian inference. This does not mean that we think Bayesian inference is a bad idea, but it does mean that there is a tension between Bayesian logic and Bayesian workflow which we believe can only be resolved by considering Bayesian logic as a tool, a way of revealing inevitable misfits and incoherences in our model assumptions, rather than as an end in itself.},

Using realistic values for all parameters, we determine the minimum fitness advantage needed to maintain a binding sequence, demonstrating explicitly the "error threshold" below which a binding sequence cannot survive the accumulated effect of mutation over long time. The commonly observed "fuzziness" in binding motifs arises naturally as a consequence of the balance between selection and mutation in our model. In addition, we devise a simple model for the evolution of multiple binding sequences in a given regulatory region. We find the number of evolutionarily stable binding sequences to increase in a step-like fashion with increasing fitness advantage, if multiple regulatory proteins can synergistically enhance gene transcription. We discuss possible experimental approaches to resolve open questions raised by our study.},

Yet biological systems ultimately need to be explained in terms of the activity, regulation and modification of proteins\textendash and the ubiquitous occurrence of post-transcriptional regulation makes mRNA an imperfect proxy for such information. To facilitate global protein analyses, we have created a Saccharomyces cerevisiae fusion library where each open reading frame is tagged with a high-affinity epitope and expressed from its natural chromosomal location. Through immunodetection of the common tag, we obtain a census of proteins expressed during log-phase growth and measurements of their absolute levels. We find that about 80\% of the proteome is expressed during normal growth conditions, and, using additional sequence information, we systematically identify misannotated genes. The abundance of proteins ranges from fewer than 50 to more than 10(6) molecules per cell. Many of these molecules, including essential proteins and most transcription factors, are present at levels that are not readily detectable by other proteomic techniques nor predictable by mRNA levels or codon bias measurements.},

However, there are certain dangers associated with mathematical modeling, and knowledge of these pitfalls should also be part of a biologist's training in this set of techniques. (1) Mathematical models are limited by known science; (2) Mathematical models can tell what can happen, but not what did happen; (3) A model does not have to conform to reality, even if it is logically consistent; (4) Models abstract from reality, and sometimes what they eliminate is critically important; (5) Mathematics can present a Platonic ideal to which biologically organized matter strives, rather than a trial-and-error bumbling through evolutionary processes. This ``Unity of Science'' approach, which sees biology as the lowest physical science and mathematics as the highest science, is part of a Western belief system, often called the Great Chain of Being (or Scala Natura), that sees knowledge emerge as one passes from biology to chemistry to physics to mathematics, in an ascending progression of reason being purification from matter. This is also an informal model for the emergence of new life. There are now other informal models for integrating development and evolution, but each has its limitations.},

  abstract = {In this article, it is investigated whether vibrational entropy (VE) is an important contribution to the free energy of globular proteins at ambient conditions. VE represents the major configurational-entropy contribution of these proteins. By definition, it is an average of the configurational entropies of the protein within single minima of the energy landscape, weighted by their occupation probabilities. Its large part originates from thermal motion of flexible torsion angles giving rise to the finite peak widths observed in torsion angle distributions. While VE may affect the equilibrium properties of proteins, it is usually neglected in numerical calculations as its consideration is difficult. Moreover, it is sometimes believed that all well-packed conformations of a globular protein have similar VE anyway. Here, we measure explicitly the VE for six different conformations from simulation data of a test protein. Estimates are obtained using the quasi-harmonic approximation for three coordinate sets, Cartesian, bond-angle-torsion (BAT), and a new set termed rotamer-degeneracy lifted BAT coordinates by us. The new set gives improved estimates as it overcomes a known shortcoming of the quasi-harmonic approximation caused by multiply populated rotamer states, and it may serve for VE estimation of macromolecules in a very general context. The obtained VE values depend considerably on the type of coordinates used. However, for all coordinate sets we find large entropy differences between the conformations, of the order of the overall stability of the protein. This result may have important implications on the choice of free energy expressions used in software for protein structure prediction, protein design, and NMR refinement.},

In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in \emph{Escherichia coli} by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations.},

We demonstrate that {$\sigma$}70 can bind in trans to TECs that emanate from either a {$\sigma$}70-dependent promoter or a promoter that is controlled by an alternative {$\sigma$} factor. We further demonstrate that binding of {$\sigma$}70 to the TEC in trans can have a particularly large impact on the dynamics of transcription elongation during stationary phase.

  abstract = {Glucose and xylose are the two most abundant sugars derived from the breakdown of lignocellulosic biomass. While aerobic glucose metabolism is relatively well understood in E. coli, until now there have been only a handful of studies focused on anaerobic glucose metabolism and no 13C-flux studies on xylose metabolism. In the absence of experimentally validated flux maps, constraint-based approaches such as MOMA and RELATCH cannot be used to guide new metabolic engineering designs. In this work, we have addressed this critical gap in current understanding by performing comprehensive characterizations of glucose and xylose metabolism under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, using recent state-of-the-art techniques in 13C metabolic flux analysis (13C-MFA). Specifically, we quantified precise metabolic fluxes for each condition by performing parallel labeling experiments and analyzing the data through integrated 13C-MFA using the optimal tracers [1,2-13C]glucose, [1,6-13C]glucose, [1,2-13C]xylose and [5-13C]xylose. We also quantified changes in biomass composition and confirmed turnover of macromolecules by applying [U-13C]glucose and [U-13C]xylose tracers. We demonstrated that under anaerobic growth conditions there is significant turnover of lipids and that a significant portion of CO2 originates from biomass turnover. Using knockout strains, we also demonstrated that {$\beta$}-oxidation is critical for anaerobic growth on xylose. Quantitative analysis of co-factor balances (NADH/FADH2, NADPH, and ATP) for different growth conditions provided new insights regarding the interplay of energy and redox metabolism and the impact on E. coli cell physiology.},

However, it is difficult to observe these dynamics directly over long periods and across entire genomes. Here we analyse the dynamics of molecular evolution in twelve experimental populations of Escherichia coli, using whole-genome metagenomic sequencing at five hundred-generation intervals through sixty thousand generations. Although the rate of fitness gain declines over time, molecular evolution is characterized by signatures of rapid adaptation throughout the duration of the experiment, with multiple beneficial variants simultaneously competing for dominance in each population. Interactions between ecological and evolutionary processes play an important role, as long-term quasi-stable coexistence arises spontaneously in most populations, and evolution continues within each clade. We also present evidence that the targets of natural selection change over time, as epistasis and historical contingency alter the strength of selection on different genes. Together, these results show that long-term adaptation to a constant environment can be a more complex and dynamic process than is often assumed.},

We review the search for simple principles in microbial evolution, ranging from the biophysical level to emergent evolutionary dynamics. A key theme has been the use of effective models, which coarse-grain over molecular and cellular details to obtain a simpler description in terms of a few effective parameters. Collectively, these theoretical approaches provide a set of quantitative principles that facilitate understanding, prediction, and potentially control of evolutionary phenomena, though formidable challenges remain due to the ecological complexity of natural populations.},

We evaluated the spatial distribution of channels in a lipid bilayer using patch-clamp electrophysiology, fluorescence and atomic force microscopy, and neutron scattering and reflection techniques, coupled with mathematical modeling of the mechanics of a membrane crowded with proteins. The results indicate that MscL forms clusters under a wide range of conditions. MscL is closely packed within each cluster but is still active and mechanosensitive. However, the channel activity is modulated by the presence of neighboring proteins, indicating membrane-mediated protein-protein interactions. Collectively, these results suggest that MscL self-assembly into channel clusters plays an osmoregulatory functional role in the membrane.},

Here, we show that the evolutionary dynamics during range expansions is highly sensitive to additional fluctuations induced by environmental heterogeneities. Tracking mutant clones with a tunable fitness effect in bacterial colonies grown on randomly patterned surfaces we found that environmental heterogeneity can dramatically reduce the efficacy of selection. Time-lapse microscopy and computer simulations suggest that this effect arises generically from a local 'pinning' of the expansion front, whereby stretches of the front are slowed down on a length scale that depends on the structure of the environmental heterogeneity. This pinning focuses the range expansion into a small number of 'lucky' individuals with access to expansion paths, altering the neutral evolutionary dynamics and increasing the importance of chance relative to selection.},

Despite the absence of a nuclear membrane, nucleoid size strongly correlates with cell size, independent of changes in DNA amount and across various nutrient conditions. This correlation is observed in diverse bacteria, revealing a near-constant ratio between nucleoid and cell size for a given species. As in eukaryotes, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio in bacteria varies greatly among species. This spectrum of nucleocytoplasmic ratios is independent of genome size, and instead it appears linked to the average population cell size. Bacteria with different nucleocytoplasmic ratios have a cytoplasm with different biophysical properties, impacting ribosome mobility and localization. Together, our findings identify new organizational principles and biophysical features of bacterial cells, implicating the nucleocytoplasmic ratio and cell size as determinants of the intracellular organization of translation.},

However, costs associated with multi-pathogen quantitative molecular diagnostics hinder their widespread use. Nano-liter qPCR (nL-qPCR) is a miniaturized tool for quantification of multiple targets in large numbers of samples based on assay parallelization on a single chip, with potentially significant cost-savings due to rapid throughput and reduced reagent volumes. We evaluated a suite of novel and published assays to detect 17 enteric pathogens using a commercially available nL-qPCR technology. Assay efficiencies ranged from 88-98\% (mean 91\%) and were reproducible across four operators at two separate facilities. When applied to complex fecal material, assays were sensitive and selective (99.8\% of DNA amplified were genes from the target organism). Detection limits were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher for nL-qPCR than an existing enteric TaqMan Array Card (TAC), due to nanofluidic volumes. Compared to the TAC, nL-qPCR displayed 97\% (95\% CI 0.96, 0.98) negative percent agreement and 63\% (95\% CI 0.60, 0.66) overall positive percent agreement. Positive percent agreement was 90\% for target concentrations above the nL-qPCR detection limits. nL-qPCR assays showed an underestimation bias of 0.34 log\textsubscript{10} copies/gram of stool [IQR -0.41, -0.28] compared with the enteric TAC. Higher detection limits, inherent to nL-qPCR, do not hinder detection of clinically relevant pathogen concentrations. With 12 times higher throughput for a sixth of the per-sample cost of the enteric TAC, the nL-qPCR chip described here is a viable alternative for enteropathogen quantification for studies where other technologies are cost-prohibitive.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules4,5 in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a `cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks6,7,8 are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability9. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80\% of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

  abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics driven out of equilibrium by growth, expansion or adaptation often generate a characteristically skewed distribution of descendant numbers: The earliest, the most advanced or the fittest ancestors have exceptionally large number of descendants, which Luria and Delbr\"uck called ``jackpot" events. Here, I show that recurrent jackpot events generate a deterministic median bias favoring majority alleles, which is akin to positive frequency-dependent selection (proportional to the log-ratio of the frequencies of mutant and wild-type alleles). This fictitious selection force results from the fact that majority alleles tend to sample deeper into the tail of the descendant distribution. The flipside of this sampling effect is the rare occurrence of large frequency hikes in favor of minority alleles, which ensures that the allele frequency dynamics remains neutral in expectation, unless genuine selection is present. The resulting picture of a selection-like bias compensated by rare big jumps allows for an intuitive understanding of allele frequency trajectories and enables the exact calculation of transition densities for a range of important scenarios, including population size variations and different forms of natural selection. As a general signature of evolution by rare events, fictitious selection hampers the establishment of new beneficial mutations, counteracts balancing selection and confounds methods to infer selection from data over limited timescales.},

Each CRP subunit contains a cyclic nucleotide binding pocket and the CRP dimer exhibits negative cooperativity in binding cAMP. In solutions containing cAMP, CRP undergoes sequential conformation changes from the inactive apo-form through the active CRP:(cAMP)1 complex to the less active CRP:(cAMP)2 complex depending on the cAMP concentration. Apo-CRP binds DNA with low affinity and no apparent sequence specificity. The CRP:(cAMP)1 complex exhibits high affinity, sequence-specific DNA binding and interacts with RNA polymerase, whether free in solution or complexed with DNA. The results of genetic, biochemical and biophysical studies have helped to uncover many of the details of cAMP-mediated allosteric control over CRP conformation and activity as a transcription factor. These studies indicate that cAMP binding produces only small, but significant, changes in CRP structure; changes that include subunit realignment and concerted motion of the secondary structure elements within the C-terminal DNA binding domain of each subunit. These adjustments promote CRP surface-patch interaction with RNA polymerase and protrusion of the F-helix to promote CRP site-specific interaction with DNA. Interactions between CRP and RNA polymerase at CRP-dependent promoters produce active ternary transcription complexes.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli contains two major systems for transporting inorganic phosphate (Pi). The low-affinity Pi transporter (pitA) is expressed constitutively and is dependent on the proton motive force, while the high-affinity Pst system (pstSCAB) is induced at low external Pi concentrations by the phoregulon and is an ABC transporter. We isolated a third putative Pi transport gene, pitB, from E. coli K-12 and present evidence that pitB encodes a functional Pi transporter that may be repressed at low Pi levels by the pho regulon. While apitB+ cosmid clone allowed growth on medium containing 500 {$\mu$}M Pi, E. coli with wild-type genomic pitB (pitA{$\Delta$}pstC345 double mutant) was unable to grow under these conditions, making it indistinguishable from a pitA pitB{$\Delta$}pstC345 triple mutant. The mutation {$\Delta$}pstC345 constitutively activates thepho regulon, which is normally induced by phosphate starvation. Removal of pho regulation by deleting thephoB-phoR operon allowed thepitB+pitA{$\Delta$}pstC345 strain to utilize Pi, with Pi uptake rates significantly higher than background levels. In addition, the apparent Kmof PitB decreased with increased levels of protein expression, suggesting that there is also regulation of the PitB protein. Strain K-10 contains a nonfunctional pitA gene and lacks Pit activity when the Pst system is mutated. The pitAmutation was identified as a single base change, causing an aspartic acid to replace glycine 220. This mutation greatly decreased the amount of PitA protein present in cell membranes, indicating that the aspartic acid substitution disrupts protein structure.},

The predictive power of a model relies on accurate quantification of model parameters. Here, we illustrate challenges in parameter quantification and offer means to overcome these challenges, using a case example in which we quantitatively predict the growth rate of a cooperative community. Specifically, the community consists of two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, each engineered to release a metabolite required and consumed by its partner. The initial model, employing parameters measured in batch monocultures with zero or excess metabolite, failed to quantitatively predict experimental results. To resolve the model\textendash experiment discrepancy, we chemically identified the correct exchanged metabolites, but this did not improve model performance. We then remeasured strain phenotypes in chemostats mimicking the metabolite-limited community environments, while mitigating or incorporating effects of rapid evolution. Almost all phenotypes we measured, including death rate, metabolite release rate, and the amount of metabolite consumed per cell birth, varied significantly with the metabolite environment. Once we used parameters measured in a range of community-like chemostat environments, prediction quantitatively agreed with experimental results. In summary, using a simplified community, we uncovered and devised means to resolve modeling challenges that are likely general to living systems.},

Transformation of these constructs into an \emph{E. coli} strain carrying an inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene allowed the specific production and labelling of MscL with [35S]methionine. Preparation of membrane fractions of \emph{E. coli} cells by sucrose gradient centrifugation indicated that the radiolabelled MscL was present in the inner cytoplasmic membrane in agreement with results of several studies. However, treatment of the labelled cells and cell membrane vesicles with various cross-linkers resulted in the majority of labelled protein migrating as a monomer with a small proportion of molecules (approximately 25\%) migrating as dimers and higher order multimers. This result is in contrast with a finding of a study suggesting that the channel exclusively forms hexamers in the cell membrane of \emph{E. coli} (1) and therefore may have profound implication for the activation and/or "multimerization" of the channel by mechanical stress exerted to the membrane. In addition, from the specific activity of the radiolabelled protein and the amount of protein in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction we estimated the number of MscL ion channels expressed under these conditions to be approximately 50 channels per single bacterium.},

  abstract = {There are two genes, fabA and fabZ, encoding {$\beta$}-hydroxyacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) dehydratases that function in the dissociated, type II fatty acid synthase system of Escherichia coli. We have investigated their roles in fatty acid synthesis by purifying the two proteins and reconstituting cycles of fatty acid synthesis in vitro using five other purified proteins. FabA and FabZ exhibited broad, overlapping chain length specificities. The FabZ dehydratase efficiently catalyzed the dehydration of short chain {$\beta$}-hydroxyacyl-ACPs and long chain saturated and unsaturated {$\beta$}-hydroxyacyl-ACPs. FabA was most active on intermediate chain length {$\beta$}-hydroxyacyl-ACPs and also possessed significant activity toward both short and long chain saturated {$\beta$}-hydroxyacyl-ACPs. Significantly, FabA was virtually inactive in the dehydration of long chain unsaturated {$\beta$}-hydroxyacyl-ACP. The introduction of the double bond at the 10-carbon stage of fatty acid synthesis by FabA was only detected in the presence of {$\beta$}-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (FabB). A yeast two-hybrid analysis failed to detect an interaction between FabA and FabB, therefore the channeling of intermediates toward unsaturated fatty acid synthesis by FabB was attributed to the affinity of the condensing enzyme for cis-decenoyl-ACP. The broad substrate specificity of FabZ coupled with the inactivity of FabA toward a long chain unsaturated {$\beta$}-hydroxyacyl-ACP provides a biochemical explanation for the phenotypes of cells with genetically altered levels of the two dehydratases.},

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive overview of the hierarchical network of intracellular processes revolving around central nitrogen metabolism in Escherichia coli. The hierarchy intertwines transport, metabolism, signaling leading to posttranslational modification, and transcription. The protein components of the network include an ammonium transporter (AmtB), a glutamine transporter (GlnHPQ), two ammonium assimilation pathways (glutamine synthetase [GS]-glutamate synthase [glutamine 2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase \{GOGAT\}] and glutamate dehydrogenase [GDH]), the two bifunctional enzymes adenylyl transferase/adenylyl-removing enzyme (ATase) and uridylyl transferase/uridylyl-removing enzyme (UTase), the two trimeric signal transduction proteins (GlnB and GlnK), the two-component regulatory system composed of the histidine protein kinase nitrogen regulator II (NRII) and the response nitrogen regulator I (NRI), three global transcriptional regulators called nitrogen assimilation control (Nac) protein, leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp), and cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp), the glutaminases, and the nitrogen-phosphotransferase system. First, the structural and molecular knowledge on these proteins is reviewed. Thereafter, the activities of the components as they engage together in transport, metabolism, signal transduction, and transcription and their regulation are discussed. Next, old and new molecular data and physiological data are put into a common perspective on integral cellular functioning, especially with the aim of resolving counterintuitive or paradoxical processes featured in nitrogen assimilation. Finally, we articulate what still remains to be discovered and what general lessons can be learned from the vast amounts of data that are available now.},

Of the elements detected, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, sulphur, chlorine, potassium, and calcium together made up 15 to 17\% of the dry matter content. A phosphorus content of 4.2 to 5.4\% of the dry matter was found in these cells. Volume measurements of air-dried cells gave an average of 1.20 to 1.25 micron3.

In vivo, the two sigma factors clearly control different genes. Yet, they are structurally and functionally very similar and basically recognize the same promoter sequences. Recent data suggest that sigma factor specificity at stress-activated promoters is affected by the interplay of the two RNA polymeraseholoenzymes with additional regulatory factors, such as H-NS, Lrp, CRP, IHF or Fis, that differentially affect transcription initiation by sigmaS or sigma70 in a promoter-specific manner.},

  abstract = {The sigma(S) (RpoS) subunit of RNA polymerase is the master regulator of the general stress response in \emph{Escherichia coli} and related bacteria. While rapidly growing cells contain very little sigma(S), exposure to many different stress conditions results in rapid and strong sigma(S) induction. Consequently, transcription of numerous sigma(S)-dependent genes is activated, many of which encode gene products with stress-protective functions. Multiple signal integration in the control of the cellular sigma(S) level is achieved by rpoS transcriptional and translational control as well as by regulated sigma(S) proteolysis, with various stress conditions differentially affecting these levels of sigma(S) control. Thus, a reduced growth rate results in increased rpoS transcription whereas high osmolarity, low temperature, acidic pH, and some late-log-phase signals stimulate the translation of already present rpoS mRNA. In addition, carbon starvation, high osmolarity, acidic pH, and high temperature result in stabilization of sigma(S), which, under nonstress conditions, is degraded with a half-life of one to several minutes. Important cis-regulatory determinants as well as trans-acting regulatory factors involved at all levels of sigma(S) regulation have been identified. rpoS translation is controlled by several proteins (Hfq and HU) and small regulatory RNAs that probably affect the secondary structure of rpoS mRNA. For sigma(S) proteolysis, the response regulator RssB is essential. RssB is a specific direct sigma(S) recognition factor, whose affinity for sigma(S) is modulated by phosphorylation of its receiver domain. RssB delivers sigma(S) to the ClpXP protease, where sigma(S) is unfolded and completely degraded. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the molecular functions and interactions of these components and tries to establish a framework for further research on the mode of multiple signal input into this complex regulatory system.},

RpoS is regulated at the levels of transcription, translation, proteolysis and protein activity. A key factor in RpoS control is the two-component response regulator RssB, which acts as a direct recognition and targeting factor for ClpXP-mediated RpoS proteolysis. A major, but not the only phosphodonor for RssB is the complex histidine sensor kinase ArcB. ArcB coordinates RpoS proteolysis with rpoS transcription by also phosphorylating the response regulator ArcA, which besides controlling a large regulon, also acts as a transcriptional repressor for rpoS. ArcB activity depends on the redox state of the respiratory chain, which links RpoS control to the balance between energy supply and available respiratory electron acceptor. In addition, the BarA/UvrY and Rcs phosphorelay systems can activate rpoS transcription and translation, respectively. These systems are involved in the control of motility, biofilm formation and/or virulence, suggesting that further studying a potential role of RpoS in these physiological functions may be rewarding.},

  abstract = {For adaptation between anaerobic, micro-aerobic and aerobic conditions Escherichia coli's metabolism and in particular its electron transport chain (ETC) is highly regulated. Although it is known that the global transcriptional regulators FNR and ArcA are involved in oxygen response it is unclear how they interplay in the regulation of ETC enzymes under micro-aerobic chemostat conditions. Also, there are diverse results which and how quinones (oxidised/reduced, ubiquinone/other quinones) are controlling the ArcBA two-component system. In the following a mathematical model of the E. coli ETC linked to basic modules for substrate uptake, fermentation product excretion and biomass formation is introduced. The kinetic modelling focusses on regulatory principles of the ETC for varying oxygen conditions in glucose-limited continuous cultures. The model is based on the balance of electron donation (glucose) and acceptance (oxygen or other acceptors). Also, it is able to account for different chemostat conditions due to changed substrate concentrations and dilution rates. The parameter identification process is divided into an estimation and a validation step based on previously published and new experimental data. The model shows that experimentally observed, qualitatively different behaviour of the ubiquinone redox state and the ArcA activity profile in the micro-aerobic range for different experimental conditions can emerge from a single network structure. The network structure features a strong feed-forward effect from the FNR regulatory system to the ArcBA regulatory system via a common control of the dehydrogenases of the ETC. The model supports the hypothesis that ubiquinone but not ubiquinol plays a key role in determining the activity of ArcBA in a glucose-limited chemostat at micro-aerobic conditions.},

Telomeric foci containing multiple DNA damage response factors were assembled in a subset of senescent cells and signaled through ATM to p53, upregulating p21 and causing G1 phase arrest. Inhibition of ATM expression or activity resulted in cell cycle reentry, indicating that stable arrest requires continuous signaling. ATR kinase appears to play a minor role in normal cells but in the absence of ATM elicited a delayed G2 phase arrest. These pathways do not affect expression of p16, which was upregulated in a telomere- and DNA damage-independent manner in a subset of cells. Distinct senescence programs can thus progress in parallel, resulting in mosaic cultures as well as individual cells responding to multiple signals.},

Analysis of the detailed results indicates that (i) metabolic coordination within the normal (Arrhenius) range is largely achieved by modulation of enzyme activity rather than amount; (ii) the restricted growth that occurs outside this range is accompanied by marked changes in the levels of most of these proteins; (iii) a few proteins are thermometer-like in varying simply with temperature over the whole temperature range irrespective of the influence of temperature on cell growth; and (iv) the temperature response of half of the proteins can be predicted from current information on their metabolic role or from their variation in level in different media at 37 degrees C.},

In a new environment, however, the same bacteria may grow poorly due to regulatory constraints or biochemical deficiencies. Adaptation to such conditions can proceed through the acquisition of new cellular functionality due to gain of function mutations or via modulation of cellular networks. Using selection experiments on transposon-mutagenized libraries of bacteria, we illustrate that even under conditions of extreme nutrient limitation, substantial adaptation can be achieved solely through loss of function mutations, which rewire the metabolism of the cell without gain of enzymatic or sensory function. A systematic analysis of similar experiments under more than 100 conditions reveals that adaptive loss of function mutations exist for many environmental challenges. Drawing on a wealth of examples from published articles, we detail the range of mechanisms through which loss-of-function mutations can generate such beneficial regulatory changes, without the need for rare, specific mutations to fine-tune enzymatic activities or network connections. The high rate at which loss-of-function mutations occur suggests that null mutations play an underappreciated role in the early stages of adaption of bacterial populations to new environments.},

Here, we present a detailed characterization of Escherichia coli growth and starvation over a time-course lasting two weeks. We have measured multiple cellular components, including RNA and proteins at deep genomic coverage, as well as lipid modifications and flux through central metabolism. Our study focuses on the physiological response of E. coli in stationary phase as a result of being starved for glucose, not on the genetic adaptation of E. coli to utilize alternative nutrients. In our analysis, we have taken advantage of the temporal correlations within and among RNA and protein abundances to identify systematic trends in gene regulation. Specifically, we have developed a general computational strategy for classifying expression-profile time courses into distinct categories in an unbiased manner. We have also developed, from dynamic models of gene expression, a framework to characterize protein degradation patterns based on the observed temporal relationships between mRNA and protein abundances. By comparing and contrasting our transcriptomic and proteomic data, we have identified several broad physiological trends in the E. coli starvation response. Strikingly, mRNAs are widely down-regulated in response to glucose starvation, presumably as a strategy for reducing new protein synthesis. By contrast, protein abundances display more varied responses. The abundances of many proteins involved in energy-intensive processes mirror the corresponding mRNA profiles while proteins involved in nutrient metabolism remain abundant even though their corresponding mRNAs are down-regulated.},

  abstract = {{$\gamma$}-Glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is a two-substrate enzyme that plays a central role in glutathione metabolism and is a potential target for drug design. GGT catalyzes the cleavage of {$\gamma$}-glutamyl donor substrates and the transfer of the {$\gamma$}-glutamyl moiety to an amine of an acceptor substrate or water. Although structures of bacterial GGT have revealed details of the protein\textendash ligand interactions at the donor site, the acceptor substrate site is relatively undefined. The recent identification of a species-specific acceptor site inhibitor, OU749, suggests that these inhibitors may be less toxic than glutamine analogues. Here we investigated the donor and acceptor substrate preferences of Bacillus anthracis GGT (CapD) and applied computational approaches in combination with kinetics to probe the structural basis of the enzyme's substrate and inhibitor binding specificities and compare them with human GGT. Site-directed mutagenesis studies showed that the R432A and R520S variants exhibited 6- and 95-fold decreases in hydrolase activity, respectively, and that their activity was not stimulated by the addition of the l-Cys acceptor substrate, suggesting an additional role in acceptor binding and/or catalysis of transpeptidation. Rat GGT (and presumably HuGGT) has strict stereospecificity for l-amino acid acceptor substrates, while CapD can utilize both l- and d-acceptor substrates comparably. Modeling and kinetic analysis suggest that R520 and R432 allow two alternate acceptor substrate binding modes for l- and d-acceptors. R432 is conserved in Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, Burkholderia mallei, Helicobacter pylori and Escherichia coli, but not in human GGT. Docking and MD simulations point toward key residues that contribute to inhibitor and acceptor substrate binding, providing a guide to designing novel and specific GGT inhibitors.},

  abstract = {In bacterial cells, the peptidoglycan cell wall is the stress-bearing structure that dictates cell shape. Although many molecular details of the composition and assembly of cell-wall components are known, how the network of peptidoglycan subunits is organized to give the cell shape during normal growth and how it is reorganized in response to damage or environmental forces have been relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce a quantitative physical model of the bacterial cell wall that predicts the mechanical response of cell shape to peptidoglycan damage and perturbation in the rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium \emph{Escherichia coli}. To test these predictions, we use time-lapse imaging experiments to show that damage often manifests as a bulge on the sidewall, coupled to large-scale bending of the cylindrical cell wall around the bulge. Our physical model also suggests a surprising robustness of cell shape to peptidoglycan defects, helping explain the observed porosity of the cell wall and the ability of cells to grow and maintain their shape even under conditions that limit peptide crosslinking. Finally, we show that many common bacterial cell shapes can be realized within the same model via simple spatial patterning of peptidoglycan defects, suggesting that minor patterning changes could underlie the great diversity of shapes observed in the bacterial kingdom.},

However, it remains unclear if these signals can also influence the behavior of distant cells that are not part of the community. Using a microfluidic approach, we find that potassium ion channel-mediated electrical signaling generated by a Bacillus subtilis biofilm can attract distant cells. Integration of experiments and mathematical modeling indicates that extracellular potassium emitted from the biofilm alters the membrane potential of distant cells, thereby directing their motility. This electrically-mediated attraction appears to be a generic mechanism that enables cross-species interactions, as Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells also become attracted to the electrical signal released by the B. subtilis biofilm. Cells within a biofilm community can thus not only coordinate their own behavior, but also influence the behavior of diverse bacteria at a distance through long-range electrical signaling.},

Here we present a simple and efficient method for examining the de novo kinetics. GFP with an immature chromophore was synthesized in a reconstituted cell-free protein synthesis system under anaerobic conditions. Chromophore maturation was initiated by rapid dilution in an air-saturated maturation buffer, and the time course of fluorescence development was monitored. Comparison of the de novo maturation rates in various GFP variants revealed that some folding mutations near the chromophore promoted rapid chromophore maturation and that the accumulation of mutations could reduce the maturation rate. Our method will contribute to the design of rapidly maturing fluorescent proteins with improved characteristics for real-time monitoring of cellular events.},

First, we show that our method recapitulates regulatory information from known sequences. Then, we examine the regulatory architectures for more than 80 promoters in the E. coli genome which previously had no known regulation. In many cases, we also identify which transcription factors mediate their regulation. The method introduced here clears a path for fully characterizing the regulatory genome of model organisms, with the potential of moving on to an array of other microbes of ecological and medical relevance.},

Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) is widely used as a tool to quantify proteins expressed in different cell types and various cellular conditions. The quantification precision of iTRAQ is quite high, but the accuracy dramatically decreases in the presence of interference peptides that are coeluted and coisolated with the target peptide. Here, we developed ``removal of interference mixture MS/MS spectra (RiMS)'' to improve the quantification accuracy of isobaric tag approaches. The presence of spectrum interference is judged by examining the overlap in the elution time of all scanned precursor ions. Removal of this interference decreased protein identification (11\% loss) but improved quantification accuracy. Further, RiMS does not require any specialized equipment, such as MS3 instruments or an additional ion separation mode. Finally, we demonstrated that RiMS can be used to quantitatively compare human-induced pluripotent stem cells and human dermal fibroblasts, as it revealed differential protein expressions that reflect the biological characteristics of the cells.},

The fossil record suggests that survivorship during mass extinctions is not strictly random, but it often fails to coincide with factors promoting survival during times of low extinction intensity. Although of very serious concern, present-day extinctions have not yet achieved the intensities seen in the Big Five mass extinctions of the geologic past, which each removed {$\geq$}50\% of the subset of relatively abundant marine invertebrate genera. The best comparisons for predictive purposes therefore will involve factors such as differential extinction intensities among regions, clades, and functional groups, rules governing postextinction biotic interchanges and evolutionary dynamics, and analyses of the factors that cause taxa and evolutionary trends to continue unabated, to suffer setbacks but resume along the same trajectory, to survive only to fall into a marginal role or disappear (``dead clade walking''), or to undergo a burst of diversification. These issues need to be addressed in a spatially explicit framework, because the fossil record suggests regional differences in postextinction diversification dynamics and biotic interchanges. Postextinction diversifications lag far behind the initial taxonomic and morphological impoverishment and homogenization; they do not simply reoccupy vacated adaptive peaks, but explore opportunities as opened and constrained by intrinsic biotic factors and the ecological and evolutionary context of the radiation.},

The present study sought to analyse the relationship between bone stability traits and egg production. The study comprised four purebred layer lines, differing in their phylogenetic origin and performance level, providing extended insight into the phenotypic variability in bone characteristics in laying hens. Data collection included basic production parameters, bone morphometry, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone breaking strength (BBS) of the tibiotarsus and humerus. Using a multifactorial model and regression analyses, BMD proved to be of outstanding importance for bone stability. Only for the tibiotarsus were morphometric parameters and the bone weight associated with BBS. Within the chicken lines, no effect of total eggshell production on BBS or BMD could be detected, suggesting that a high egg yield itself is not necessarily a risk for poor bone health. Considering the complexity of osteoporosis, the estimated genetic parameters confirmed the importance of genetics in addressing the challenge of improving bone strength in layers.},

We find that initial genotype strongly affects adaptability and can alter the genetic basis of future evolution. Initial genotype also affects the pleiotropic consequences of adaptation for fitness in a different environment. This genetic variation in adaptability and pleiotropy is largely determined by initial fitness, according to a rule of declining adaptability with increasing initial fitness, but several individual QTLs also have a significant idiosyncratic role. Our results demonstrate that both adaptability and pleiotropy are complex traits, with extensive heritable differences arising from naturally occurring variation.},

Many important issues in bacterial physiology are inherently quantitative, and major contributors to the field have often brought together tools and ways of thinking from multiple disciplines. This article presents a comprehensive overview of major ideas and approaches developed since the early 20th century for anyone who is interested in the fundamental problems in bacterial physiology. This article is divided into two parts. In the first part (sections 1\textendash 3), we review the first `golden era' of bacterial physiology from the 1940s to early 1970s and provide a complete list of major references from that period. In the second part (sections 4\textendash 7), we explain how the pioneering work from the first golden era has influenced various rediscoveries of general quantitative principles and significant further development in modern bacterial physiology. Specifically, section 4 presents the history and current progress of the `adder' principle of cell size homeostasis. Section 5 discusses the implications of coarsegraining the cellular protein composition, and how the coarse-grained proteome `sectors' re-balance under different growth conditions. Section 6 focuses on physiological invariants, and explains how they are the key to understanding the coordination between growth and the cell cycle underlying cell size control in steady-state growth. Section 7 overviews how the temporal organization of all the internal processes enables balanced growth. In the final section 8, we conclude by discussing the remaining challenges for the future in the field.},

Next, DnaA interacts with DnaB helicase in loading the DnaB-DnaC complex on each separated strand.

  abstract = {The mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) is a bacterial tension-driven osmolyte release valve with homologues in many walled eukaryotic organisms. When stimulated by steps of tension in excised patches, \emph{Escherichia coli} MscS exhibits transient opening followed by reversible adaptation and then complete inactivation. Here, we study properties of the inactivation transition, which renders MscS nonconductive and tension insensitive. Using special pressure protocols we demonstrate that adaptation and inactivation are sequential processes with opposite tension dependencies. In contrast to many eukaryotic channels, which inactivate from the open state, MscS inactivates primarily from the closed state because full openings by preconditioning pulses do not influence the degree of inactivation, and saturating tensions keeping channels open prevent inactivation. The easily opened A98S mutant lacks inactivation completely, whereas the L111S mutant with a right-shifted activation curve inactivates silently before reaching the threshold for opening. This suggests that opening and inactivation are two independent tension-driven pathways, both starting from the closed state. Analysis of tension dependencies for inactivation and recovery rates estimated the in-plane expansion (DeltaA) associated with inactivation as 8.5 nm(2), which is about half of the area change for opening. Given that the interhelical contact between the outer TM1-TM2 pairs and the core TM3s is the force-transmitting path from the periphery to the gate, the determined DeltaA now can be used as a constraining parameter for the models of the inactivated state in which the lipid-facing TM1-TM2 pairs are displaced and uncoupled from the gate.},

  abstract = {We present a macroscopic theory to characterize the plasticity, robustness, and evolvability of biological responses and their fluctuations. First, linear approximation in intracellular reaction dynamics is used to demonstrate proportional changes in the expression of all cellular components in response to a given environmental stress, with the proportion coefficient determined by the change in growth rate as a consequence of the steady growth of cells. We further demonstrate that this relationship is supported through adaptation experiments of bacteria, perhaps too well as this proportionality is held even across cultures of different types of conditions. On the basis of simulations of cell models, we further show that this global proportionality is a consequence of evolution in which expression changes in response to environmental or genetic perturbations are constrained along a unique one-dimensional curve, which is a result of evolutionary robustness. It then follows that the expression changes induced by environmental changes are proportionally reduced across different components of a cell by evolution, which is akin to the Le Chatelier thermodynamics principle. Finally, with the aid of a fluctuation-response relationship, this proportionality is shown to hold between fluctuations caused by genetic changes and those caused by noise. Overall, these results and support from the theoretical and experimental literature suggest a formulation of cellular systems akin to thermodynamics, in which a macroscopic potential is given by the growth rate (or fitness) represented as a function of environmental and evolutionary changes.},

  abstract = {Binding of genome regulatory proteins to nonspecific DNA sites may play an important role in controlling the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interactions of these proteins with their specific target DNA sequences. An estimate of the fraction of Escherichia coli lac repressor molecules bound in vivo to the operator region and to nonoperator sites on the E. coli chromosome is derived by measurement of the distribution of repressor between a minicell-producing E. coli strain (P678-54) and the DNA-free minicells derived therefrom. Assuming the minicell cytoplasm to be representative of that of the parent E. coli cells, we find that less than 10\% of the repressor tetramers of the average cell are free in solution; the remainder are presumed to be bound to the bacterial chromosome. The minimum in vivo value of the association constant for repressor to bulk nonoperator DNA (KRD) calculated from these results is about 103 M-1, and analysis of the sources of error in the minicell experiment suggests that the actual in vivo value of KRD could be substantially greater. The value of KRD, coupled with in vitro data on the ionic strength dependence of this parameter, can be used to estimate that the effective intracellular cation activity of E. coli is no greater than about 0.24 M (and probably no less than 0.17 M) in terms of sodium ion equivalents. The minicell distribution experiments also confirm that the association constant for the binding of inducer-repressor complex to bulk nonoperator DNA (KRID) is [unk] KRDin vivo. These results are used to calculate minimum in vivo values of KRO and KRIO (association constants for repressor and for inducer-repressor complex binding to operator) of about 1012 M-1 and about 109 M-1, respectively. The results fit a quantitative model for operon regulation in which nonspecific DNA-repressor complexes play a key role in determining basal and constitutive levels of gene expression [von Hippel, P.

  abstract = {Many cellular populations are tightly packed, such as microbial colonies and biofilms, or tissues and tumours in multicellular organisms. The movement of one cell in these crowded assemblages requires motion of others, so that cell displacements are correlated over many cell diameters. Whenever movement is important for survival or growth, these correlated rearrangements could couple the evolutionary fate of different lineages. However, little is known about the interplay between mechanical forces and evolution in dense cellular populations. Here, by tracking slower-growing clones at the expanding edge of yeast colonies, we show that the collective motion of cells prevents costly mutations from being weeded out rapidly. Joint pushing by neighbouring cells generates correlated movements that suppress the differential displacements required for selection to act. This mechanical screening of fitness differences allows slower-growing mutants to leave more descendants than expected under non-mechanical models, thereby increasing their chance for evolutionary rescue. Our work suggests that, in crowded populations, cells cooperate with surrounding neighbours through inevitable mechanical interactions. This effect has to be considered when predicting evolutionary outcomes, such as the emergence of drug resistance or cancer evolution. Slower-growing yeast clones at the colony edge have their fitness disadvantage masked by the collective motion of neighbouring cells, reducing the rate at which costly mutations are selected against.},

The origins of this stochastic behavior can be traced to the random transitions among the discrete chemical states of operators that control the transcription rate and to finite number fluctuations in the biochemical reactions for the synthesis and degradation of transcripts. We develop stochastic models to which these random reactions are intrinsic and a series of simpler models derived explicitly from the first as approximations in different parameter regimes. This innate stochasticity can have both a quantitative and qualitative impact on the behavior of gene-regulatory networks. We introduce a natural generalization of deterministic bifurcations for classification of stochastic systems and show that simple noisy genetic switches have rich bifurcation structures; among them, bifurcations driven solely by changing the rate of operator fluctuations even as the underlying deterministic system remains unchanged. We find stochastic bistability where the deterministic equations predict monostability and vice-versa. We derive and solve equations for the mean waiting times for spontaneous transitions between quasistable states in these switches.},

Obligate GroEL-dependence is limited to only {$\sim$}85 substrates, including 13 essential proteins, and occupying more than 75\% of GroEL capacity. These proteins appear to populate kinetically trapped intermediates during folding; they are stabilized by TF/DnaK against aggregation but reach native state only upon transfer to GroEL/GroES. Interestingly, substantially enriched among the GroEL substrates are proteins with ({$\beta\alpha$})8 TIM-barrel domains. We suggest that the chaperonin system may have facilitated the evolution of this fold into a versatile platform for the implementation of numerous enzymatic functions.},

Importantly, we identify two distinct regimes of behavior, depending on the relative energies of the two states of the receptors. In regime I, coupling of receptors leads to high sensitivity, while in regime II, coupling of receptors leads to high cooperativity, i.e., high Hill coefficient.

  abstract = {Defining the molecular strategies that integrate diverse signalling pathways in the expression of specific gene programmes that are critical in homeostasis and disease remains a central issue in biology. This is particularly pertinent in cancer biology because downregulation of tumour metastasis suppressor genes is a common occurrence, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well established. Here we report that the downregulation of a metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, in prostate cancer cells involves the inhibitory actions of beta-catenin, along with a reptin chromatin remodelling complex. This inhibitory function of beta-catenin-reptin requires both increased beta-catenin expression and recruitment of histone deacetylase activity. The coordinated actions of beta-catenin-reptin components that mediate the repressive state serve to antagonize a Tip60 coactivator complex that is required for activation; the balance of these opposing complexes controls the expression of KAI1 and metastatic potential. The molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonistic regulation of beta-catenin-reptin and the Tip60 coactivator complexes for the metastasis suppressor gene, KAI1, are likely to be prototypic of a selective downregulation strategy for many genes, including a subset of NF-kappaB target genes.},

  abstract = {Complex biological systems are very robust to genetic and environmental changes at all levels of organization. Many biological functions of Escherichia coli metabolism can be sustained against single-gene or even multiple-gene mutations by using redundant or alternative pathways. Thus, only a limited number of genes have been identified to be lethal to the cell. In this regard, the reaction-centric gene deletion study has a limitation in understanding the metabolic robustness. Here, we report the use of flux-sum, which is the summation of all incoming or outgoing fluxes around a particular metabolite under pseudo-steady state conditions, as a good conserved property for elucidating such robustness of E. coli from the metabolite point of view. The functional behavior, as well as the structural and evolutionary properties of metabolites essential to the cell survival, was investigated by means of a constraints-based flux analysis under perturbed conditions. The essential metabolites are capable of maintaining a steady flux-sum even against severe perturbation by actively redistributing the relevant fluxes. Disrupting the flux-sum maintenance was found to suppress cell growth. This approach of analyzing metabolite essentiality provides insight into cellular robustness and concomitant fragility, which can be used for several applications, including the development of new drugs for treating pathogens.},

  abstract = {Genes are often transcribed by multiple RNA polymerases (RNAPs) at densities that can vary widely across genes and environmental conditions. Here, we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for a built-in mechanism by which co-transcribing RNAPs display either collaborative or antagonistic dynamics over long distances ({$>$}2 kb) through transcription-induced DNA supercoiling. In Escherichia coli, when the promoter is active, co-transcribing RNAPs translocate faster than a single RNAP, but their average speed is not altered by large variations in promoter strength and thus RNAP density. Environmentally induced promoter repression reduces the elongation efficiency of already-loaded RNAPs, causing premature termination and quick synthesis arrest of no-longerneeded proteins. This negative effect appears independent of RNAP convoy formation and is abrogated by topoisomerase I activity. Antagonistic dynamics can also occur between RNAPs from divergently transcribed gene pairs. Our findings may be broadly applicable given that transcription on topologically constrained DNA is the norm across organisms.},

Here, we investigated the influence of posttranscriptional modification of bacterial tRNAs (tRNA modification) on tRNA stability. We focused on ThiI-generated 4-thiouridine (s4U), a modification found in bacterial and archaeal tRNAs. Comprehensive quantification of Vibrio cholerae tRNAs revealed that the abundance of some tRNAs is decreased in a {$\Delta$}thiI strain in a stationary phase-specific manner. Multiple mechanisms, including rapid degradation of a subset of hypomodified tRNAs, account for the reduced abundance of tRNAs in the absence of thiI. Through transposon insertion sequencing, we identified additional tRNA modifications that promote tRNA stability and bacterial viability. Genetic analysis of suppressor mutants as well as biochemical analyses revealed that rapid degradation of hypomodified tRNA is mediated by the RNA degradosome. Elongation factor Tu seems to compete with the RNA degradosome, protecting aminoacyl tRNAs from decay. Together, our observations describe a previously unrecognized bacterial tRNA quality control system in which hypomodification sensitizes tRNAs to decay mediated by the RNA degradosome.},

However, chronic granulomatous disease neutrophils, which do not produce ROMs, did not display ROM deposition. Matrices show an alternating pattern of green (proteolytic) and red (oxidative) fluorescence, indicating these functions are out of phase. Electric fields phase-matched with metabolic oscillations, which increase the amplitude of intracellular NAD(P)H oscillations, increase ROM deposition and pericellular proteolysis; this further supports the link between intracellular chemical oscillators and extracellular functions. This phase relationship may allow ROMs to inactivate protease inhibitors, followed by protease activation.},

It is notoriously difficult even when the adaptive mutations are known because it is hard to enumerate which phenotypes make these mutations adaptive. We address this problem by first quantifying how the fitness of hundreds of adaptive yeast mutants responds to subtle environmental shifts and then modeling the number of phenotypes they must collectively influence by decomposing these patterns of fitness variation. We find that a small number of phenotypes predicts fitness of the adaptive mutations near their original glucose-limited evolution condition. Importantly, phenotypes that matter little to fitness at or near the evolution condition can matter strongly in distant environments. This suggests that adaptive mutations are locally modular - affecting a small number of phenotypes that matter to fitness in the environment where they evolved - yet globally pleiotropic - affecting additional phenotypes that may reduce or improve fitness in new environments.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In response to stresses such as sudden carbon starvation, osmotic upshift or shift to acidic pH, sigmaS degradation is inhibited, sigmaS accumulates and numerous sigmaS-dependent genes with stress-protective functions are activated. sigmaS proteolysis is dependent on ClpXP protease and the response regulator RssB, whose phosphorylated form binds directly to sigmaS in vitro. Here, we show that substitutions of aspartate 58 (D58) in RssB, which result in higher sigmaS levels in vivo, produce RssB variants unable to bind sigmaS in vitro. Thus, RssB is the direct substrate recognition factor in sigmaS proteolysis, whose affinity for sigmaS depends on phosphorylation of its D58 residue. RssB does not dimerize or oligomerize upon this phosphorylation and sigmaS binding, and RssB and sigmaS exhibit a 1:1 stoichiometry in the complex. The receiver as well as the output domain of RssB are required for sigmaS binding (as shown in vivo and in vitro) and for complementation of an rssB null mutation. Thus, the N-terminal receiver domain plays an active and positive role in RssB function. Finally, we demonstrate that RssB is not co-degraded with sigmaS, i.e. RssB has a catalytic role in the initiation of sigmaS turnover. A model is presented that integrates the details of RssB-sigmaS interaction, the RssB catalytic cycle and potential stress signal input in the control of sigmaS proteolysis.},

Because the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells depends on the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of promoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration, which is difficult to quantify directly. Here, we develop a simple physical model describing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs transcribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs nonspecifically bound to DNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for Escherichia coli allow us to determine the 2 unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to predict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive (unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate-dependent regulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in transcription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene expression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP expression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the case of the stringent response after amino acid starvation, we can evaluate the plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control proposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and biosynthetic operons.},

Understanding of these global effects is necessary for a quantitative understanding of gene regulation and for the design of synthetic genetic circuits. We find that the observed growth-rate dependence of constitutive gene expression can be explained by a simple model using the measured growth-rate dependence of the relevant cellular parameters. More complex growth dependencies for genetic circuits involving activators, repressors, and feedback control were analyzed and verified experimentally with synthetic circuits. Additional results suggest a feedback mechanism mediated by general growth-dependent effects that does not require explicit gene regulation if the expressed protein affects cell growth. This mechanism can lead to growth bistability and promote the acquisition of important physiological functions such as antibiotic resistance and tolerance (persistence).},

Here, we show that the slow diffusion of the bulky tRNA complexes in the crowded cytoplasm imposes a physical limit on the speed of translation, which ultimately limits the rate of cell growth. To study the required allocation of ancillary translational proteins to alleviate the effect of molecular crowding, we develop a model for cell growth based on a coarse-grained partitioning of the proteome. We find that coregulation of ribosome- and tRNA-affiliated proteins is consistent with measured growth-rate dependencies and results in near-optimal allocation over a broad range of growth rates. The analysis further resolves a long-standing controversy in bacterial growth physiology concerning the growth-rate dependence of translation speed and serves as a caution against premature identification of phenomenological parameters with mechanistic processes.},

  abstract = {Expression levels of individual copies of an inducible gene have been presumed to be identical to the averaged level of many copies and to change in a smooth and predictable way according to the concentration of an inducing molecule. However, our recent experiments using a steroid-inducible system showed that the expression levels of individual copies are very heterogeneous and do not necessarily coincide with the averaged expression level of many copies (Ko et al., 1990, EMBO J. 9, 2835\textendash 2842). To explain this result, I present a stochastic model for gene induction here and its analysis using computer simulation. Stochasticity in the model is derived from the randomness corresponding to the random timing of molecular collisions and dissociations between transcription factors and a gene copy, since at any instant each copy is thought to be either ``switched on'' by having a transcription complex bound to it, or ``switched off' by not having a transcription complex bound. This model can produce two types of gene induction that depend on the stability of the transcription complex on the regulatory region of the gene. An unstable transcription complex causes a homogeneous level of gene induction among individual copies, while a stable transcription complex causes a heterogeneous level. Since the recent consensus formed by in vitro transcription experiments is that the transcription complex is generally very stable, the latter case (the non-deterministic one) is highly possible. Since typical eukaryotic cells have just two copies for any gene in a single cell, this possibility of heterogeneous gene induction indicates that the phenotypes of individual cells cannot be precisely determined by just environmental signals, such as inducers. This may prompt us to reconsider many problems related to gene induction, including morphogenesis.},

  abstract = {Background: Sequence alignment is a prolific basis of functional annotation, but remains a challenging problem in the 'twilight zone' of high sequence divergence or short gene length. Here we demonstrate how information on gene interactions can help to resolve ambiguous sequence alignments. We compare two distant Herpes viruses by constructing a graph alignment, which is based jointly on the similarity of their protein interaction networks and on sequence similarity. This hybrid method provides functional associations between proteins of the two organisms that cannot be obtained from sequence or interaction data alone.
Results: We find proteins where interaction similarity and sequence similarity are individually weak, but together provide significant evidence of orthology. There are also proteins with high interaction similarity but without any detectable sequence similarity, providing evidence of functional association beyond sequence homology. The functional predictions derived from our alignment are consistent with genomic position and gene expression data.
Conclusion: Our approach shows that evolutionary conservation is a powerful filter to make protein interaction data informative about functional similarities between the interacting proteins, and it establishes graph alignment as a powerful tool for the comparative analysis of data from highly diverged species.},

Here we present a quantitative analysis, based on the kinetics of ribosome self-replication, demonstrating that the 1{$:$}2 protein-to-RNA mass ratio uniquely maximizes cellular growth rates in E. coli. A previously unrecognized growth law, and an invariant of bacterial growth, also follow from our analysis. The growth law reveals that the ratio between the number of ribosomes and the number of polymerases making ribosomal RNA is proportional to the cellular doubling time. The invariant is conserved across growth conditions and specifies how key microscopic parameters in the cell, such as transcription and translation rates, are coupled to cellular physiology. Quantitative predictions from the growth law and invariant are shown to be in excellent agreement with E. coli data despite having no fitting parameters. Our analysis can be readily extended to other bacteria once data become available.},

A short-term memory required for such comparisons is provided by the adaptation system, which operates through the activity-dependent methylation of chemotaxis receptors. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that efficient navigation in gradients requires a well-defined adaptation rate, because the memory time scale needs to match the duration of straight runs made by bacteria. Here we demonstrate that the chemotaxis pathway of \emph{Escherichia coli} does indeed exhibit a universal relation between the response magnitude and adaptation time which does not depend on the type of chemical ligand. Our results suggest that this alignment of adaptation rates for different ligands is achieved through cooperative interactions among chemoreceptors rather than through fine-tuning of methylation rates for individual receptors. This observation illustrates a yet-unrecognized function of receptor clustering in bacterial chemotaxis.},

  abstract = {Bacteria navigate within inhomogeneous environments by temporally comparing concentrations of chemoeffectors over the course of a few seconds and biasing their rate of reorientations accordingly, thereby drifting towards more favorable conditions. This navigation requires a short-term memory achieved through the sequential methylations and demethylations of several specific glutamate residues on the chemotaxis receptors, which progressively adjusts the receptors' activity to track the levels of stimulation encountered by the cell with a delay. Such adaptation also tunes the receptors' sensitivity according to the background ligand concentration, enabling the cells to respond to fractional rather than absolute concentration changes, i.e. to perform logarithmic sensing. Despite the adaptation system being principally well understood, the need for a specific number of methylation sites remains relatively unclear. Here we systematically substituted the four glutamate residues of the Tar receptor of \emph{Escherichia coli} by non-methylated alanine, creating a set of 16 modified receptors with a varying number of available methylation sites and explored the effect of these substitutions on the performance of the chemotaxis system. Alanine substitutions were found to desensitize the receptors, similarly but to a lesser extent than glutamate methylation, and to affect the methylation and demethylation rates of the remaining sites in a site-specific manner. Each substitution reduces the dynamic range of chemotaxis, by one order of magnitude on average. The substitution of up to two sites could be partly compensated by the adaptation system, but the full set of methylation sites was necessary to achieve efficient logarithmic sensing.},

  abstract = {Many pathogens exist in phenotypically distinct strains that interact with each other through competition for hosts. General models that describe such multi-strain systems are extremely difficult to analyze because their state spaces are enormously large. Reduced models have been proposed, but so far all of them necessarily allow for coinfections and require that immunity be mediated solely by reduced infectivity, a potentially problematic assumption. Here, we suggest a new state-space reduction approach that allows immunity to be mediated by either reduced infectivity or reduced susceptibility and that can naturally be used for models with or without coinfections. Our approach utilizes the general framework of status-based models. The cornerstone of our method is the introduction of immunity variables, which describe multi-strain systems more naturally than the traditional tracking of susceptible and infected hosts. Models expressed in this way can be approximated in a natural way by a truncation method that is akin to moment closure, allowing us to sharply reduce the size of the state space, and thus to consider models with many strains in a tractable manner. Applying our method to the phenomenon of antigenic drift in influenza A, we propose a potentially general mechanism that could constrain viral evolution to a one-dimensional manifold in a two-dimensional trait space. Our framework broadens the class of multi-strain systems that can be adequately described by reduced models. It permits computational, and even analytical, investigation and thus serves as a useful tool for understanding the evolution and ecology of multi-strain pathogens.},

Many characteristics of HA's sequence evolution are captured by standard Markov chain substitution models. Such models assign equal fitness to all accessible amino acids at a site. We show, however, that such models strongly underestimate the number of homoplastic amino acid substitutions during the course of HA's evolution, i.e. substitutions that repeatedly give rise to the same amino acid at a site. We develop statistics to detect individual homoplastic events and find that they preferentially occur at positively selected epitopic sites. Our results suggest that the evolution of the influenza A HA, including evolution by positive selection, is strongly affected by the long-term site-specific preferences for individual amino acids.},

The dN/dS ratio was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences, the differences among which represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. Nevertheless, the dN/dS measure is often applied to sequences sampled from a single population, the differences among which represent segregating polymorphisms. Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population under selection, and we find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS{$>$}1, is violated within a population. For population samples, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS.

We find that fitness and substitution trajectories depend not on the full distribution of fitness effects of available mutations but rather on the expected fixation probability and the expected fitness increment of mutations.

At this rate, simple models of diffusion lead to the expectation that LacI and other proteins will rapidly homogenize throughout the cell. Here, we test this expectation of spatial homogeneity by single-molecule visualization of LacI molecules non-specifically bound to DNA in fixed cells. Contrary to expectation, we find that the distribution depends on the spatial location of its encoding gene. We demonstrate that the spatial distribution of LacI is also determined by the local state of DNA compaction, and that E. coli can dynamically redistribute proteins by modifying the state of its nucleoid. Finally, we show that LacI inhomogeneity increases the strength with which targets located proximally to the LacI gene are regulated. We propose a model for intranucleoid diffusion that can reconcile these results with previous measurements of LacI diffusion, and we discuss the implications of these findings for gene regulation in bacteria and eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Many allosteric proteins form homo-oligomeric complexes to regulate a biological function. In homo-oligomers, subunits establish communication pathways that are modulated by external stimuli like ligand binding. A challenge for dissecting the communication mechanisms in homo-oligomers is identifying intermediate liganded states, which are typically transiently populated. However, their identities provide the most mechanistic information on how ligand-induced signals propagate from bound to empty subunits. Here, we dissected the directionality and magnitude of subunit communication in a reengineered single-chain version of the homodimeric transcription factor cAMP receptor protein. By combining wild-type and mutant subunits in various asymmetric configurations, we revealed a linear relationship between the magnitude of cooperative effects and the number of mutant subunits. We found that a single mutation is sufficient to change the global allosteric behavior of the dimer even when one subunit was wild type. Dimers harboring two mutations with opposite cooperative effects had different allosteric properties depending on the arrangement of the mutations. When the two mutations were placed in the same subunit, the resulting cooperativity was neutral. In contrast, when placed in different subunits, the observed cooperativity was dominated by the mutation with strongest effects over cAMP affinity relative to wild type. These results highlight the distinct roles of intrasubunit interactions and intersubunit communication in allostery. Finally, dimers bound to either one or two cAMP molecules had similar DNA affinities, indicating that both asymmetric and symmetric liganded states activate DNA interactions. These studies have revealed the multiple communication pathways that homo-oligomers employ to transduce signals.},

  abstract = {The second vegetative sigma factor sigma S (encoded by the rpoS gene) is the master regulator in a complex regulatory network that governs the expression of many stationary phase-induced and osmotically regulated genes in \emph{Escherichia coli}. Using a combination of gene-fusion technology and quantitative immunoblot, pulse-labeling, and immunoprecipitation analyses, we demonstrate here that rpoS/sigma S expression is not only transcriptionally controlled, but is also extensively regulated at the levels of translation and protein stability. rpoS transcription is inversely correlated with growth rate and is negatively controlled by cAMP-CRP. In complex medium rpoS transcription is stimulated during entry into stationary phase, whereas in minimal media, it is not significantly induced. rpoS translation is stimulated during transition into stationary phase as well as by an increase in medium osmolarity. A model involving mRNA secondary structure is suggested for this novel type of post-transcriptional growth phase-dependent and osmotic regulation. Furthermore, sigma S is a highly unstable protein in exponentially growing cells (with a half-life of 1.4 min), that is stabilized at the onset of starvation. When cells are grown in minimal glucose medium, translational induction and sigma S stabilization occur in a temporal order with the former being stimulated already in late exponential phase and the latter taking place at the onset of starvation. Although sigma S does not control its own transcription, it is apparently indirectly involved in a negative feedback control that operates on the post-transcriptional level. Our analysis also indicates that at least five different signals [cAMP, a growth rate-related signal (ppGpp?), a cell density signal, an osmotic signal, and a starvation signal] are involved in the control of all these processes that regulate rpoS/sigma S expression.},

  abstract = {Signal transmission among cells enables long-range coordination in biological systems. However, the scarcity of quantitative measurements hinders the development of theories that relate signal propagation to cellular heterogeneity and spatial organization. We address this problem in a bacterial community that employs electrochemical cell-to-cell communication. We developed a model based on percolation theory, which describes how signals propagate through a heterogeneous medium. Our model predicts that signal transmission becomes possible when the community is organized near a critical phase transition between a disconnected and a fully connected conduit of signaling cells. By measuring population-level signal transmission with single-cell resolution in wild-type and genetically modified communities, we confirm that the spatial distribution of signaling cells is organized at the predicted phase transition. Our findings suggest that at this critical point, the population-level benefit of signal transmission outweighs the single-cell level cost. The bacterial community thus appears to be organized according to a theoretically predicted spatial heterogeneity that promotes efficient signal transmission.},

  abstract = {Membrane transporters carry key metabolites across the cell membrane and, from a resource standpoint, are hypothesized to be produced when necessary. The expression of membrane transporters in metabolic pathways is often upregulated by the transporter substrate. In E. coli, such systems include for example the lacY, araFGH, and xylFGH genes, which encode for lactose, arabinose, and xylose transporters, respectively. As a case study of a minimal system, we build a generalizable physical model of the xapABR genetic circuit, which features a regulatory feedback loop via membrane transport (positive feedback) and enzymatic degradation (negative feedback) of an inducer. Dynamical systems analysis and stochastic simulations show that the membrane transport makes the model system bistable in certain parameter regimes. Thus, it serves as a genetic ``on-off'' switch, enabling the cell to only produce a set of metabolic enzymes when the corresponding metabolite is present in large amounts. We find that the negative feedback from the degradation enzyme does not significantly disturb the positive feedback from the membrane transporter. We investigate hysteresis in the switching and discuss the role of cooperativity and multiple binding sites in the model circuit. Fundamentally, this work explores how a stable genetic switch for a set of enzymes is obtained from transcriptional auto-activation of a membrane transporter through its substrate.},

Higher resilience is typically ascribed to ``dormant'' non-growing cellular states.

Specifically, we observed two types of cellular behavior: growth-defective cells exhibited a mathematically predicted transient increase in membrane potential (hyperpolarization), followed by cell death, whereas growing cells lacked hyperpolarization events and showed elevated survival. Using structural perturbations of the ribosome and proteomic analysis, we uncovered that stress resilience arises from magnesium influx, which prevents hyperpolarization. Thus, ion flux modulation provides a distinct mechanism to cope with ribosomal stress. These results suggest new approaches to increase the effectiveness of ribosome-targeting antibiotics and reveal an intriguing connection between ribosomes and the membrane potential, two fundamental properties of cells.},

Leuenberger et al. explored thermostability on a proteome-wide scale in bacteria, yeast, and human cells by using a combination of limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry (see the Perspective by Vogel). Their results suggest that temperature-induced cell death is caused by the loss of a subset of proteins with key functions.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONTemperature is crucially important to life. Small temperature changes can differentiate optimal and lethal growth conditions of living organisms. Because of the higher abundance and lower stability of proteins as compared with those of other biological macromolecules, thermally induced cell death is thought to be due to protein denaturation, but the determinants of thermal sensitivity of proteomes remain largely uncharacterized.
RATIONALETo determine the thermal stability of proteins on a proteome-wide scale and with domain-level resolution, we developed a structural proteomic approach that relies on limited proteolysis (LiP) and mass spectrometry (MS) applied over a range of temperatures.
RESULTSOur LiP-MS strategy was validated through analysis of purified proteins in the presence and absence of a biologically relevant matrix. We then obtained proteome-wide thermal denaturation profiles for Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Thermus thermophilus, and human cells. In contrast to previous predications that proteome instability derives from the simultaneous and generalized loss of hundreds of proteins, we observed that at a temperature at which cells experience temperature-induced physiological impairment, a subset of essential proteins undergoes denaturation.Confirming results of previous studies on the basis of comparison of genomes of thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria, we observed enrichment for lysine residues and {$\beta$}-sheet structures in thermostable proteins. We also found that unstable proteins have a higher content of aspartic acid than that of stable proteins and observed an inverse correlation between protein length and thermal stability. Further, thermostable proteins are substantially less prone to thermal aggregation than unstable proteins.Relative domain thermostability was conserved both within species and across organisms. Thermal stability was not generally similar for proteins encoded by orthologous genes. This suggests that the melting temperatures of proteins are affected by the reshuffling of protein domains, despite the conservation of domain stability.According to the ``translational robustness'' theory, highly expressed proteins must tolerate translational errors that can lead to the accumulation of toxic misfolded species. Our data show a clear direct relationship between protein thermal stability and intracellular abundance and an inverse relationship between protein stability and aggregation or local unfolding. Increasing the thermodynamic stabilities of the folds of abundant proteins will broaden the range of amino acid replacements that a protein can tolerate before misfolding. Our findings suggest that over the course of evolution, the burden of intracellular misfolding has been reduced by increasing the thermodynamic stability of abundant proteins. Last, although up to 30\% of proteomes have been predicted to consist of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), our data revealed that about half of these proteins showed two-state denaturation profiles in the cellular matrix. This suggests that many IDPs are globally or locally structured in cells.
CONCLUSIONOur study contributes insight into the molecular and evolutionary bases of protein and proteome thermostability and provides a blueprint for future studies on the stability of proteomes and thermal denaturation. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/355/6327/eaai7825/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Protein-protein interaction network of E. coli.Node color indicates protein thermostability.

At the temperature of thermal cell death of E. coli, a subset of highly connected protein nodes involved in key cellular processes undergoes temperature-induced denaturation.
Temperature-induced cell death is thought to be due to protein denaturation, but the determinants of thermal sensitivity of proteomes remain largely uncharacterized. We developed a structural proteomic strategy to measure protein thermostability on a proteome-wide scale and with domain-level resolution. We applied it to Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Thermus thermophilus, and human cells, yielding thermostability data for more than 8000 proteins. Our results (i) indicate that temperature-induced cellular collapse is due to the loss of a subset of proteins with key functions, (ii) shed light on the evolutionary conservation of protein and domain stability, and (iii) suggest that natively disordered proteins in a cell are less prevalent than predicted and (iv) that highly expressed proteins are stable because they are designed to tolerate translational errors that would lead to the accumulation of toxic misfolded species.
Proteomic analysis provides insight into the molecular and evolutionary bases of proteins and proteome thermal stability.

  abstract = {The acknowledged success of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) allosteric model stems from its efficacy in accounting for the functional behavior of many complex proteins starting with hemoglobin (the paradigmatic case) and extending to channels and receptors. The kinetic aspects of the allosteric model, however, have been often neglected, with the exception of hemoglobin and a few other proteins where conformational relaxations can be triggered by a short and intense laser pulse, and monitored by time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Only recently the application of time-resolved wide-angle X-ray scattering (TR-WAXS), a direct structurally sensitive technique, unveiled the time scale of hemoglobin quaternary structural transition. In order to test the generality of the MWC kinetic model, we carried out a TR-WAXS investigation in parallel on adult human hemoglobin and on a recombinant protein (HbYQ) carrying two mutations at the active site [Leu(B10)Tyr and His(E7)Gln]. HbYQ seemed an ideal test because, although exhibiting allosteric properties, its kinetic and structural properties are different from adult human hemoglobin. The structural dynamics of HbYQ unveiled by TR-WAXS can be quantitatively accounted for by the MWC kinetic model. Interestingly, the main structural change associated with the R\textendash T allosteric transition (i.e., the relative rotation and translation of the dimers) is approximately 10-fold slower in HbYQ, and the drop in the allosteric transition rate with ligand saturation is steeper. Our results extend the general validity of the MWC kinetic model and reveal peculiar thermodynamic properties of HbYQ. A possible structural interpretation of the characteristic kinetic behavior of HbYQ is also discussed.},

Electrophysiological measurements have identified multiple channels in \emph{Escherichia coli} cells. One gene, mscL, encoding a large conductance channel has previously been described, but null mutants were without well-defined phenotypes. Here, we report the characterization of a new gene family required for MscS function, YggB and KefA, which has enabled a rigorous test of the role of the channels. The channel determined by KefA does not appear to have a major role in managing the transition from high to low osmolarity. In contrast, analysis of mutants of E.coli lacking YggB and MscL shows that mechanosensitive channels are designed to open at a pressure change just below that which would cause cell disruption leading to death.},

However, the dynamics underlying these evolutionary processes remain poorly understood because they involve many competing beneficial lineages, most of which never rise above extremely low frequencies in the population. To observe these normally hidden evolutionary dynamics, we constructed a sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage tracking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that allowed us to monitor the relative frequencies of {$\sim$}500,000 lineages simultaneously. In contrast to some expectations, we found that the spectrum of fitness effects of beneficial mutations is neither exponential nor monotonic. Early adaptation is a predictable consequence of this spectrum and is strikingly reproducible, but the initial small-effect mutations are soon outcompeted by rarer large-effect mutations that result in variability between replicates. These results suggest that early evolutionary dynamics may be deterministic for a period of time before stochastic effects become important.},

This article aims to give a broad perspective on the composition of proteomes as gleaned from recent quantitative proteomics studies. We describe proteomaps, an approach for visualizing the composition of proteomes with a focus on protein abundances and functions. In proteomaps, each protein is shown as a polygon-shaped tile, with an area representing protein abundance. Functionally related proteins appear in adjacent regions. General trends in proteomes, such as the dominance of metabolism and protein production, become easily visible. We make interactive visualizations of published proteome datasets accessible at www.proteomaps.net. We suggest that evaluating the way protein resources are allocated by various organisms and cell types in different conditions will sharpen our understanding of how and why cells regulate the composition of their proteomes.},

Largely because of advances in the techniques of molecular biology in the past few decades, our knowledge of regulation by most of these mechanisms has expanded enormously. Regulation by small-molecule, allosteric interactions is an exception. Many of the best-known allosteric regulators were discovered decades ago, when we knew little about all of these other forms of regulation. Allostery is the most direct, rapid, and efficient regulatory mechanism to sense changes in the concentration of small molecules and alter cellular responses to maintain homeostasis. In this perspective, we present the argument that allosteric regulation is underappreciated in the systems biology world and that many allosteric effectors remain to be discovered.},

Gene induction occurs in a hierarchical manner and includes many factors for uptake and metabolism of better but currently unavailable carbon sources. Concomitantly, cells also increase their motility. Thus, as the growth potential of the environment decreases, cells appear to devote progressively more energy on the mere possibility of improving conditions. This adaptation is not what would be predicated by classic regulatory models alone. We also observe an inverse correlation between gene activation and rRNA synthesis suggesting that reapportioning RNA polymerase (RNAP) contributes to the expanded genome activation. Significant differences in RNAP distribution in vivo, monitored using an RNAP-green fluorescent protein fusion, from energy-rich and energy-poor carbon source cultures support this hypothesis. Together, these findings represent the integration of both substrate-specific and global regulatory systems, and may be a bacterial approximation to metazoan risk-prone foraging behavior.},

  abstract = {The ability of cells to sense and respond to mechanical force underlies diverse processes such as touch and hearing in animals, gravitropism in plants, and bacterial osmoregulation. In bacteria, mechanosensation is mediated by the mechanosensitive channels of large (MscL), small (MscS), potassium-dependent (MscK) and mini (MscM) conductances. These channels act as 'emergency relief valves' protecting bacteria from lysis upon acute osmotic down-shock. Among them, MscL has been intensively studied since the original identification and characterization 15 years ago. MscL is reversibly and directly gated by changes in membrane tension. In the open state, MscL forms a non-selective 3 nS conductance channel which gates at tensions close to the lytic limit of the bacterial membrane. An earlier crystal structure at 3.5 A resolution of a pentameric MscL from Mycobacterium tuberculosis represents a closed-state or non-conducting conformation. MscL has a complex gating behaviour; it exhibits several intermediates between the closed and open states, including one putative non-conductive expanded state and at least three sub-conducting states. Although our understanding of the closed and open states of MscL has been increasing, little is known about the structures of the intermediate states despite their importance in elucidating the complete gating process of MscL. Here we present the crystal structure of a carboxy-terminal truncation mutant (Delta95-120) of MscL from Staphylococcus aureus (SaMscL(CDelta26)) at 3.8 A resolution. Notably, SaMscL(CDelta26) forms a tetrameric channel with both transmembrane helices tilted away from the membrane normal at angles close to that inferred for the open state, probably corresponding to a non-conductive but partially expanded intermediate state.},

To determine the extent by which absolute TF concentration dictates gene expression and morphogenesis programs that ultimately lead to patterns in Drosophila embryos, we manipulate maternally supplied patterning determinants and measure readout concentration at the position of various developmental markers. When we increase the overall amount of the maternal TF Bicoid (Bcd) fivefold, Bcd concentrations in cells at positions of the cephalic furrow, an early morphological marker, differ by a factor of 2. This finding apparently contradicts the traditional threshold-dependent readout model, which predicts that the Bcd concentrations at these positions should be identical. In contrast, Bcd concentration at target gene expression boundaries is nearly unchanged early in development but adjusts dynamically toward the same twofold change as development progresses. Thus, the Drosophila segmentation gene network responds faithfully to Bcd concentration during early development, in agreement with the threshold model, but subsequently partially adapts in response to altered Bcd dosage, driving segmentation patterns toward their WT positions. This dynamic response requires other maternal regulators, such as Torso and Nanos, suggesting that integration of maternal input information is not achieved through molecular interactions at the time of readout but through the subsequent collective interplay of the network.},

However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box\textendash Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis. \textcopyright{} 2008 International Society for Analytical Cytology},

The successes of Monod, from the 1950s to the Noble Prize (1965), are already well documented. In this paper, I will focus on the Monod before Monod, that is, the Monod who, during the 1940s, tried to explain the fundamental phenomenon of enzymatic adaptation. To begin with, however, I will survey how this phenomenon was discovered and explained by French Pasteurians at the very beginning of the twentieth century. This first explanation took place amidst an entrenched Lamarckian atmosphere in French thought, which was still alive during the 1920s and the 1930s, when Monod commenced the study of biology at the Sorbonne. Because of his will to construct a scientific biology free from teleology, Monod always tried to break from the legacy of this traditional background of Lamarckism, and he consequently developed ways of thinking that, in the main, were not part of the French biological tradition. Nevertheless, one point did link Monod to French history: his fruitful interactions with Andr\'e Lwoff. As we shall see, these interactions were necessary for the development of Monod's science, both technically and intellectually speaking.},

Furthermore, a high concentration of lactose was shown to overcome diauxie in a CR+ strain. Studies on the induction of {$\beta$}-galactosidase by lactose suggested that glucose inhibits induction by 10-2m lactose. Preinduction of the lac operon was found to overcome this effect. The ability of glucose to prevent expression of the lac operon by reducing the internal concentration of inducer as well as by catabolite repression is discussed.},

Using DIGE, we also examined the relative changes in protein expression when cells were grown in the presence and absence of amino acids. A total of 23 different proteins were identified whose abundance changed significantly between the two conditions. Most of these changes were found to be associated with proteins involved in carbon and amino acid metabolism, transport, and chemotaxis.

This pathway culminates in the production of the peptidoglycan layer, which is composed of polymerized glycan chains with cross-linked peptide substituents. This layer forms the major structural component of the protective barrier known as the cell wall. Disruption in the assembly of the peptidoglycan layer causes a weakened cell wall and subsequent bacterial lysis. With bacteria responsible for both properly functioning human health (probiotic strains) and potentially serious illness (pathogenic strains), a delicate balance is necessary during clinical intervention. Recent research has furthered our understanding of the precise molecular structures, mechanisms of action, and functional interactions involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. This research is helping guide our understanding of how to capitalize on peptidoglycanbased therapeutics and, at a more fundamental level, of the complex machinery that creates this critical barrier for bacterial survival.},

The potential of mean force characterizing glycerol in the channel shows a corresponding asymmetry with an attractive vestibule only at the periplasmic side. In this study, we analyze the potential of mean force, showing that a simplified six-step model captures the kinetics and yields a glycerol conduction rate that agrees well with observation. The vestibule improves the conduction rate by 40\% and 75\% at 10-mM and 10-mM periplasmic glycerol concentrations, respectively. In addition, neither the conduction rate nor the conduction probability for a single glycerol (efficiency) depends on the orientation of GlpF. GlpF appears to conduct equally well in both directions under physiological conditions.},

APEX relies upon correcting each protein's mass spectrometry sampling depth (observed peptide count) by learned probabilities for identifying the peptides. APEX abundances agree with measurements from controls, western blotting, flow cytometry and two-dimensional gels, as well as known correlations with mRNA abundances and codon bias, providing absolute protein concentrations across approximately three to four orders of magnitude. Using APEX, we demonstrate that 73\% of the variance in yeast protein abundance (47\% in \emph{E. coli}) is explained by mRNA abundance, with the number of proteins per mRNA log-normally distributed about approximately 5,600 ( approximately 540 in \emph{E. coli}) protein molecules/mRNA. Therefore, levels of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are set per mRNA molecule and independently of overall protein concentration, with {$>$}70\% of yeast gene expression regulation occurring through mRNA-directed mechanisms.},

  abstract = {An enduring mystery of evolutionary genomics concerns the mechanisms responsible for lineage-specific expansions of genome size in eukaryotes, especially in multicellular species. One idea is that all excess DNA is mutationally hazardous, but weakly enough so that genome-size expansion passively emerges in species experiencing relatively low efficiency of selection owing to small effective population sizes. Another idea is that substantial gene additions were impossible without the energetic boost provided by the colonizing mitochondrion in the eukaryotic lineage. Contrary to this latter view, analysis of cellular energetics and genomics data from a wide variety of species indicates that, relative to the lifetime ATP requirements of a cell, the costs of a gene at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels decline with cell volume in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Moreover, these costs are usually sufficiently large to be perceived by natural selection in bacterial populations, but not in eukaryotes experiencing high levels of random genetic drift. Thus, for scaling reasons that are not yet understood, by virtue of their large size alone, eukaryotic cells are subject to a broader set of opportunities for the colonization of novel genes manifesting weakly advantageous or even transiently disadvantageous phenotypic effects. These results indicate that the origin of the mitochondrion was not a prerequisite for genome-size expansion.},

Can a bacterial cell model vet large datasets from disparate sources? Macklin et al. explored whether a comprehensive mathematical model can be used to verify or find conflicts in massive amounts of data that have been reported for the bacterium Escherichia coli, produced in thousands of papers from hundreds of labs. Although most data were consistent, there were data that could not accommodate known biological results, such as insufficient output of RNA polymerases and ribosomes to produce measured cell-doubling times. Other analyses showed that for some essential proteins, no RNA may be transcribed or translated in a cell's lifetime, but viability can be maintained without certain enzymes through a pool of stable metabolites produced earlier.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONThe generation of biological data is presenting us with one of the most demanding analysis challenges the world has ever faced, not only in terms of storage and accessibility, but more critically in terms of its extensive heterogeneity and variability. Although issues associated with heterogeneity and variability each represent major analysis problems on their own, the challenges posed by both in combination are even more difficult but also present greater opportunities. The problems arise because assessing the data's veracity means not only determining whether the data are reproducible but also, and perhaps more deeply, whether they are cross-consistent, meaning that the interpretations of multiple heterogeneous datasets all point to the same conclusion. The opportunities emerge because seemingly discrepant results across multiple studies and measurement modalities may not be due simply to the errors associated with particular techniques, but also to the complex, nonlinear, and highly interconnected nature of biology. Therefore, what is required are analysis methods that can integrate and evaluate multiple data types simultaneously and in the context of biological mechanisms.
RATIONALEHere, we present a large-scale, integrated modeling approach to simultaneously cross-evaluate millions of heterogeneous data against themselves, based on an extensive computer model of Escherichia coli that accounts for the function of 1214 genes (or 43\% of the well-annotated genes). The model incorporates an extensive set of diverse measurements compiled from thousands of reports and accounting for many decades of research performed in laboratories around the world. Curation of these data led to the identification of {$>$}19,000 parameter values, which we integrated by creating a computational model that brings molecular signaling and regulation of RNA and protein expression together with carbon and energy metabolism in the context of balanced growth. A major advantage of this modeling approach is that heterogeneous data are linked mechanistically through the simulated interaction of cellular processes, providing the most natural, intuitive interpretation of an integrated dataset. Thus, this model enabled us to assess the cross-consistency of all of these datasets as an integrated whole.
RESULTSWe assessed the cross-consistency of the parameter set and identified areas of inconsistency by populating our model with the literature-derived parameters and by running detailed simulations of cellular life cycles. Although analysis of these simulations showed that most of the data were in fact cross-consistent, we also identified critical areas in which the data incorporated in our model were not. These inconsistencies led to readily observable consequences, including that the total output of the ribosomes and RNA polymerases described by the data are not sufficient for a cell to reproduce measured doubling times, that measured metabolic parameters are neither fully compatible with each other nor with overall growth, and that essential proteins are absent during the cell cycle\textemdash and the cell is robust to this absence. After correcting for these inconsistencies, the model is capable of validatable predictions compared with previously withheld data. Finally, considering these data as a whole led to successful predictions in vitro, in this case protein half-lives.
CONCLUSIONConstruction of a highly integrative and mechanistic mathematical model provided us with an opportunity to integrate and cross-validate a vast, heterogeneous dataset in E. coli, a process we now call ``deep curation'' to reflect the multiple layers of curation that we perform (analogous to ``deep learning'' and ``deep sequencing''). By highlighting areas in which studies in E. coli contradict each other, our work suggests lines of fruitful experimental inquiry that may help to resolve discrepancies, leading to both new biological insights and a more coherent understanding of this critical model organism. We hope that this work, by demonstrating the value of a large-scale integrative approach to understanding, interpreting, and cross-validating large datasets, will inspire further efforts to comprehensively characterize other organisms of interest. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/369/6502/eaav3751/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Integrating experimental and computational components, scientists constructed a model of E. coli.

The extensive heterogeneity of biological data poses challenges to analysis and interpretation. Construction of a large-scale mechanistic model of Escherichia coli enabled us to integrate and cross-evaluate a massive, heterogeneous dataset based on measurements reported by various groups over decades. We identified inconsistencies with functional consequences across the data, including that the total output of the ribosomes and RNA polymerases described by data are not sufficient for a cell to reproduce measured doubling times, that measured metabolic parameters are neither fully compatible with each other nor with overall growth, and that essential proteins are absent during the cell cycle\textemdash and the cell is robust to this absence. Finally, considering these data as a whole leads to successful predictions of new experimental outcomes, in this case protein half-lives.
Construction of a large-scale mechanistic model of Escherichia coli brings models and large datasets together to enhance knowledge in biology.

However, important research directions, particularly those involving mathematical modelling and simulation of biological processes, also critically depend on absolutely quantitative data\textendash that is, knowledge of the concentration of the expressed proteins as a function of cellular state. Until now, absolute protein concentration measurements of a considerable fraction of the proteome (73\%) have only been derived from genetically altered Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, a technique that is not directly portable from yeast to other species. Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based strategy to determine the absolute quantity, that is, the average number of protein copies per cell in a cell population, for a large fraction of the proteome in genetically unperturbed cells. Applying the technology to the human pathogen Leptospira interrogans, a spirochete responsible for leptospirosis, we generated an absolute protein abundance scale for 83\% of the mass-spectrometry-detectable proteome, from cells at different states. Taking advantage of the unique cellular dimensions of L. interrogans, we used cryo-electron tomography morphological measurements to verify, at the single-cell level, the average absolute abundance values of selected proteins determined by mass spectrometry on a population of cells. Because the strategy is relatively fast and applicable to any cell type, we expect that it will become a cornerstone of quantitative biology and systems biology.},

  abstract = {Levels of RpoS increase upon glucose starvation in \emph{Escherichia coli}, which leads to the transcription of genes whose products combat a variety of stresses. RpoS stability is a key level of control in this process, as SprE (RssB)-mediated degradation is inhibited under glucose starvation. Starvation for ammonia or phosphate also results in increased stress resistance and induction of RpoS-dependent genes. However, we demonstrate that RpoS levels following ammonia starvation are only slightly increased compared to growing cells and are 10-fold below the levels observed under glucose or phosphate limitation. This difference is largely due to regulated proteolysis of RpoS, as its stability in ammonia-starved cells is intermediate between that in logarithmic-phase cells and glucose-starved cells. Use of an rpoS construct that is devoid of the gene's native transcriptional and translational control regions reveals that stability differences are sufficient to explain the different levels of RpoS observed in logarithmic phase, ammonia starvation, and glucose starvation. Under phosphate starvation, however, rpoS translation is increased. The cellular response to nutrient limitation is much more complex than previously appreciated, as there is not simply one response that is activated by starvation for any essential nutrient. Our data support the hypothesis that SprE activity is the key level at which ammonia and glucose starvation signals are transmitted to RpoS, and they suggest that carbon source and/or energy limitation are necessary for full inactivation of the SprE pathway.},

Our approach made use of the unique genomic associations of specific reductive dehalogenase subunit A encoding genes (rdhA) that exist in known strains of Dehalococcoides mccartyi and Desulfitobacterium and the distinguishing covariance pattern of observed rdhA genes to assign genes to unknown strains. To test this approach, we operated five anaerobic reductively dechlorinating chemostats for 3\textendash 4 years with tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene as terminal electron acceptors and lactate/formate as electron donors. The presence and abundance of rdhA genes were determined comprehensively at the community level using a custom-developed Reductive Dehalogenase Chip (RDH Chip) DNA microarray and used to define putative strains of Dehalococcoides mccartyi and Desulfitobacterium sp. This monitoring revealed that stable chemical performance of chemostats was reflected by a stable community of reductively dechlorinating bacteria. However, perturbations introduced by, for example, electron donor limitation or addition of the competing electron acceptor sulfate led to overall changes in the chemostat performance, including incomplete reduction in the chloroethene substrates, and in the population composition of reductively dehalogenating bacteria. Interestingly, there was a high diversity of operationally defined D. mccartyi strains between the chemostats with almost all strains unique to their specific chemostats in spite of similar selective pressure and similar inocula shared between chemostats.},

  abstract = {Background
Glycerol has enhanced its biotechnological importance since it is a byproduct of biodiesel synthesis. A study of Escherichia coli physiology during growth on glycerol was performed combining transcriptional-proteomic analysis as well as kinetic and stoichiometric evaluations in the strain JM101 and certain derivatives with important inactivated genes.

Results
Transcriptional and proteomic analysis of metabolic central genes of strain JM101 growing on glycerol, revealed important changes not only in the synthesis of MglB, LamB and MalE proteins, but also in the overexpression of carbon scavenging genes: lamB, malE, mglB, mglC, galP and glk and some members of the RpoS regulon (pfkA, pfkB, fbaA, fbaB, pgi, poxB, acs, actP and acnA). Inactivation of rpoS had an important effect on stoichiometric parameters and growth adaptation on glycerol. The observed overexpression of poxB, pta, acs genes, glyoxylate shunt genes (aceA, aceB, glcB and glcC) and actP, suggested a possible carbon flux deviation into the PoxB, Acs and glyoxylate shunt. In this scenario acetate synthesized from pyruvate with PoxB was apparently reutilized via Acs and the glyoxylate shunt enzymes. In agreement, no acetate was detected when growing on glycerol, this strain was also capable of glycerol and acetate coutilization when growing in mineral media and derivatives carrying inactivated poxB or pckA genes, accumulated acetate. Tryptophanase A (TnaA) was synthesized at high levels and indole was produced by this enzyme, in strain JM101 growing on glycerol. Additionally, in the isogenic derivative with the inactivated tnaA gene, no indole was detected and acetate and lactate were accumulated. A high efficiency aromatic compounds production capability was detected in JM101 carrying pJLBaroGfbrtktA, when growing on glycerol, as compared to glucose.

Conclusions
The overexpression of several carbon scavenging, acetate metabolism genes and the absence of acetate accumulation occurred in JM101 cultures growing on glycerol. To explain these results it is proposed that in addition to the glycolytic metabolism, a gluconeogenic carbon recycling process that involves acetate is occurring simultaneously in this strain when growing on glycerol. Carbon flux from glycerol can be efficiently redirected in JM101 strain into the aromatic pathway using appropriate tools.},

  abstract = {Sensing extracellular changes initiates signal transduction and is the first stage of cellular decision-making. Yet relatively little is known about why one form of sensing biochemistry has been selected over another. To gain insight into this question, we studied the sensing characteristics of one of the biochemically simplest of sensors: the allosteric transcription factor. Such proteins, common in microbes, directly transduce the detection of a sensed molecule to changes in gene regulation. Using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model, we determined six sensing characteristics \textendash{} the dynamic range, the Hill number, the intrinsic noise, the information transfer capacity, the static gain, and the mean response time \textendash{} as a function of the biochemical parameters of individual sensors and of the number of sensors. We found that specifying one characteristic strongly constrains others. For example, a high dynamic range implies a high Hill number and a high capacity, and vice versa. Perhaps surprisingly, these constraints are so strong that most of the space of characteristics is inaccessible given biophysically plausible ranges of parameter values. Within our approximations, we can calculate the probability distribution of the numbers of input molecules that maximizes information transfer and show that a population of one hundred allosteric transcription factors can in principle distinguish between more than four bands of input concentrations. Our results imply that allosteric sensors are unlikely to have been selected for high performance in one sensing characteristic but for a compromise in the performance of many.},

Lipopolysaccharide, an essential glycolipid located in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane, greatly contributes to the peculiar properties exhibited by the outer membrane. This complex molecule is transported to the cell surface by a molecular machine composed of seven essential proteins LptABCDEFG that form a transenvelope complex and function as a single device. While advances in understanding the mechanisms that govern the biogenesis of the cell envelope have been recently made, only few studies are available on how bacterial cells respond to severe envelope biogenesis defects on a global scale. Here we report the use of differential proteomics based on Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) to investigate how Escherichia coli cells respond to a block of lipopolysaccharide transport to the outer membrane. We analysed the envelope proteome of a lptC conditional mutant grown under permissive and non permissive conditions and identified 123 proteins whose level is modulated upon LptC depletion. Most such proteins belong to pathways implicated in cell envelope biogenesis, peptidoglycan remodelling, cell division and protein folding. Overall these data contribute to our understanding on how E. coli cells respond to LPS transport defects to restore outer membrane functionality.},

In this rapid and unbiased protocol, immobilized trypsin is used in the presence of deoxycholate and lauroylsarcosine to increase digestion efficiency as well as to increase the solubility of the membrane proteins. Using 22.5 {$\mu$}g of Escherichia coli whole cell lysate, we quantitatively demonstrated that membrane proteins were extracted and digested at the same level as soluble proteins without any solubility-related bias. The recovery of membrane proteins was independent of the number of transmembrane domains per protein. In the analysis of the membrane-enriched fraction from 22.5 {$\mu$}g of E. coli cell lysate, the abundance distribution of the membrane proteins was in agreement with that of the membrane protein-coding genes when this protocol, coupled with strong cation exchange prefractionation prior to nano-LC-MS/MS analysis, was used. Because this protocol allows unbiased sample preparation, protein abundance estimation based on the number of observed peptides per protein was applied to both soluble and membrane proteins simultaneously, and the copy numbers per cell for 1,453 E. coli proteins, including 545 membrane proteins, were successfully obtained. Finally, this protocol was applied to quantitative analysis of guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphate-dependent signaling in E. coli wild-type and relA knock-out strains.},

While subunits of protein complexes residing in one compartment melted similarly, protein complexes spanning compartments often had their subunits melting in a location-wise manner. Monitoring the E.~coli meltome and proteome at different growth phases captured changes in metabolism. Cells lacking TolC, a component of multiple efflux pumps, exhibited major physiological changes, including differential thermostability and levels of its interaction partners, signaling cascades, and periplasmic quality control. Finally, we combined in~vitro and in~vivo TPP to identify targets of known antimicrobial drugs and to map their downstream effects.

The C-terminal region of the {$\alpha$} subunit is predicted to contain an oligonucleotide binding (OB-fold) domain. In a series of optical tweezers experiments, the {$\alpha$} subunit is shown to have an affinity for both double- and single-stranded DNA, in distinct subdomains of the protein. The portion of the protein that binds to double-stranded DNA stabilizes the DNA helix, because protein binding must be at least partially disrupted with increasing force to melt DNA. Upon relaxation, the DNA fails to fully reanneal, because bound protein interferes with the reformation of the double helix. In addition, the single-stranded DNA binding component appears to be passive, as the protein does not facilitate melting but instead binds to single-stranded regions already separated by force. From DNA stretching measurements we determine equilibrium association constants for the binding of {$\alpha$} and several fragments to dsDNA and ssDNA. The results demonstrate that ssDNA binding is localized to the C-terminal region that contains the OB-fold domain, while a tandem helix-hairpin-helix (HhH)2 motif contributes significantly to dsDNA binding.},

  abstract = {Since the domestication of plant and animal species around 10,000 years ago, cultivation and animal husbandry have been major components of global change. Agricultural activities such as tillage, fertilization, and biomass alteration lead to fundamental changes in the pools and fluxes of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) that originally existed in native ecosystems. Land is often taken out of agricultural production for economic, social, or biological reasons, and the ability to predict the biogeochemical trajectory of this land is important to our understanding of ecosystem development and our projections of food security for the future. Tillage generally decreases soil organic matter (SOM) due to erosion and disruption of the physical, biochemical, and chemical mechanisms of SOM stabilization, but SOM can generally reaccumulate after the cessation of cultivation. The use of organic amendments causes increases in SOM on agricultural fields that can last for centuries to millennia after the termination of applications, although the locations that provide the organic amendments are concurrently depleted. The legacy of agriculture is therefore highly variable on decadal to millennial time scales and depends on the specific management practices that are followed during the agricultural period. State factors such as climate and parent material (particularly clay content and mineralogy) modify ecosystem processes such that they may be useful predictors of rates of postagricultural biogeochemical change. In addition to accurate biogeochemical budgets of postagricultural systems, ecosystem models that more explicitly incorporate mechanisms of SOM loss and formation with agricultural practices will be helpful. Developing this predictive capacity will aid in ecological restoration efforts and improve the management of modern agroecosystems as demands on agriculture become more pressing.},

Population structure effectively promotes cooperation given that a threshold in the level of cooperation was already reached. However, the question how cooperation can emerge from a single mutant, which cannot rely on a benefit provided by other cooperators, is still puzzling. Here, we investigate this question for a well-defined but generic situation based on typical life cycles of microbial populations where individuals regularly form new colonies followed by growth phases. We analyse two evolutionary mechanisms favouring cooperative behaviour and study their strength depending on the inoculation size and the length of a life cycle. In particular, we find that population bottlenecks followed by exponential growth phases strongly increase the survival and fixation probabilities of a single cooperator in a free-riding population.},

  abstract = {\emph{Escherichia coli} like most gram-negative bacteria with walls maintains a cytoplasmic osmolarity exceeding that of the medium; the resulting hydrostatic pressure (turgor pressure) pushes the cytoplasmic membrane against the peptidoglycan and creates a tension in the two envelopes. Potassium is the only cation which takes part in the regulation of cellular osmolarity. The adaptation of intracellular K+ concentration to external osmolarity involves K+ turgor-controlled fluxes. When the medium osmolarity is raised an osmodependent influx of K+ can be observed; this is carried out by the K+ transport system TrkA which can also taken up rubidium. A specific and unidirectional pathway allows K+ ions to flow out of the cell when the medium osmolarity is decreased; this pathway reveals two characteristics: it has no affinity for rubidium and it can be blocked by the blockers of eukaryotic K+ channels. Osmodependent fluxes are turned on immediately after the medium osmolarity is disturbed; in contrast, they are turned off gradually as the rate of K+ fluxes approach zero. The rate of K+ influx seems to depend on the level of internal osmolarity and not on the extent of the increase in medium osmolarity. The rate of the efflux is directly proportional to the decrease in medium osmolarity and is independent on the level of internal osmolarity.},

Many, if not all, molecular actors involved in transcription initiation are known but the mechanisms underlying the frequency of initiations, remain elusive. To make the connection between transcription factors and the frequency of transcription initiation, intricated aspects of this complex activity are classified i) depending on whether or not the DNA-bound transcription factors directly activate the commitment to transcription and ii) on the destructive or non-destructive effect of transcription initiation on the stability of promoter complexes. Two possible sources of synergy allowing the combinatorial specificity of transcription factors action are compared, for binding to DNA and for recruiting transcription machineries. Tentative formulations are proposed to discriminate the different micro-reversible modes of DNA binding cooperativity modulating the specificity and dosage of transcription initiation.},

  abstract = {Blood Falls is the surface manifestation of brine released from below the Taylor Glacier, McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica. Geochemical analyses of Blood Falls show that this brine is of a marine origin. The discovery that 74\% of clones and isolates from Blood Falls share high 16S rRNA gene sequence homology with phylotypes from marine systems supports this contention. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene clone library was dominated by a phylotype that had 99\% sequence identity with Thiomicrospira arctica (46\% of the library), a psychrophilic marine autotrophic sulfur oxidizer. The remainder of the library contained phylotypes related to the classes Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria and the division Bacteroidetes and included clones whose closest cultured relatives metabolize iron and sulfur compounds. These findings are consistent with the high iron and sulfate concentrations detected in Blood Falls, which are likely due to the interactions of the subglacial brine with the underlying iron-rich bedrock. Our results, together with previous reports, suggest that the brine below the Taylor Glacier hosts a viable ecosystem with microorganisms capable of growth, supported by chemical energy present in reduced iron and sulfur compounds. The metabolic and phylogenetic structure of this subglacial microbial assemblage appears to be controlled by glacier hydrology, bedrock lithology, and the preglacial ecosystem.},

The results showed that the osmotic pressure gradient of rehydration shock realized before plating greatly affected cell viability. When rehydration occurred quickly from an hyperosmotic level of 133 MPa in glycerol solution before slow rehydration by plating on an agar surface to reach initial osmotic pressure (1.4 MPa), bacterial viability was strongly related to the intensity of the hypo-osmotic gradient used. Rehydration to 107 MPa resulted in a survival ratio of 41\%, whereas strong rehydration to 1.4 MPa resulted in only 0.7\% survival. These studies also demonstrated the influence of the rehydration kinetic on cell recovery. An optimal rehydration rate of 0.136 MPa x s(-1) increased cell recovery by a factor of 40 when compared with the faster and slower rates of 131.6 MPa x s(-1) and 0.006 MPa x s(-1), respectively.},

PhoA protein fusion data, combined with the positive-inside rule, strongly support a model in which MscS crosses the membrane three times, adopting an N(out)-C(in) configuration. Deletion data suggest that the C-terminal domain of the protein is essential for the stability of the MscS channel, whereas the protein will tolerate small deletions at the N-terminus. Four mutants that exhibit either gain-of-function (GOF) or loss-of-function have been identified: a double mutation I48D/S49P inactivates MscS, whereas the MscS mutants T93R, A102P and L109S cause a strong GOF phenotype. The similarity of MscS to the last two domains of MscK (formerly KefA) is reinforced by the demonstration that expression of a truncated MscK protein can substitute for MscL and MscS in downshock survival assays. The data derived from studies of the organization, conservation and the influence of mutations provide significant insights into the structure of the MscS channel.},

  abstract = {Physiological and evolutionary adaptations operate at very different time scales. Nevertheless, there are reasons to believe there should be a strong relationship between the two, as together they modify the phenotype. Physiological adaptations change phenotype by altering certain microscopic parameters; evolutionary adaptation can either alter genetically these same parameters or others to achieve distinct or similar ends. Although qualitative discussions of this relationship abound, there has been very little quantitative analysis. Here, we use the hemoglobin molecule as a model system to quantify the relationship between physiological and evolutionary adaptations. We compare measurements of oxygen saturation curves of 25 mammals with those of human hemoglobin under a wide range of physiological conditions. We fit the data sets to the Monod\textendash Wyman\textendash Changeux model to extract microscopic parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that physiological and evolutionary change act on different parameters. The main parameter that changes in the physiology of hemoglobin is relatively constant in evolution, whereas the main parameter that changes in the evolution of hemoglobin is relatively constant in physiology. This orthogonality suggests continued selection for physiological adaptability and hints at a role for this adaptability in evolutionary change.},

  abstract = {Cooperative binding of transcription factors (TFs) to promoters and other regulatory regions is essential for precise gene expression. The classical model of cooperativity requires direct interactions between TFs, thus constraining the arrangement of TF sites in regulatory regions. Recent genomic and functional studies, however, demonstrate a great deal of flexibility in such arrangements with variable distances, numbers of sites, and identities of TF sites located in cis-regulatory regions. Such flexibility is inconsistent with cooperativity by direct interactions between TFs. Here, we demonstrate that strong cooperativity among noninteracting TFs can be achieved by their competition with nucleosomes. We find that the mechanism of nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is analogous to cooperativity in another multimolecular complex: hemoglobin. This surprising analogy provides deep insights, with parallels between the heterotropic regulation of hemoglobin (e.g., the Bohr effect) and the roles of nucleosome-positioning sequences and chromatin modifications in gene expression. Nucleosome-mediated cooperativity is consistent with several experimental studies, is equally applicable to repressors and activators, allows substantial flexibility in and modularity of regulatory regions, and provides a rationale for a broad range of genomic and evolutionary observations. Striking parallels between cooperativity in hemoglobin and in transcriptional regulation point to a general mechanism that can be used in various biological systems.},

Using logistic regression model, predicted mortality rate (PMR) function was calculated, and used to establish TBI severities. We determined a BOP of 145 kPa as upper mild TBI threshold (5\% PMR). Also we determined 146\textendash 220 kPa and 221\textendash 290 kPa levels as moderate and severe TBI based on 35\%, and 70\% PMR, respectively, while BOP above 290 kPa is lethal. Since there are no standards for animal bTBI injury severity, these thresholds need further refinements using histopathology, immunohistochemistry and behavior. Further, we specifically investigated mild TBI range (0\textendash 145 kPa) using physiological (heart rate), pathological (lung injury), immuno-histochemical (oxidative/nitrosative and blood-brain barrier markers) as well as blood borne biomarkers. With these additional data, we conclude that mild bTBI occurs in rats when the BOP is in the range of 85\textendash 145 kPa.},

A simple statistical model recovers the observed ribosome-nucleoid segregation remarkably well. Plectonemic DNA is represented as a hyperbranched hard-sphere polymer, and multiple ribosomes that simultaneously translate the same mRNA strand (polysomes) are represented as freely jointed chains of hard spheres. There are no attractive interactions between particles, only excluded-volume effects. At realistic DNA and ribosome concentrations, segregation arises primarily from two effects: the DNA polymer avoids walls to maximize conformational entropy, and the polysomes occupy the empty space near the walls to maximize translational entropy. In this complex system, maximizing total entropy results in spatial organization of the components. Due to coupling of mRNA to DNA through RNA polymerase, the same entropic effects should favor the placement of highly expressed genes at the interface between the nucleoid and the ribosome-rich periphery. Such a placement would enable efficient cotranscriptional translation and facile transertion of membrane proteins into the cytoplasmic membrane. Finally, in the model, monofunctional DNA polymer beads representing the tips of plectonemes preferentially locate near the cylindrical wall. This suggests that initiation of transcription may occur preferentially near the ribosome-rich periphery.},

  abstract = {Bacterial {$\sigma$} factors compete for binding to RNA polymerase (RNAP) to control promoter selection, and in some cases interact with RNAP to regulate at least the early stages of transcript elongation. However, the effective concentration of {$\sigma$}s in vivo, and the extent to which {$\sigma$} can regulate transcript elongation generally, are unknown. We report that tethering {$\sigma$}70 to all RNAP molecules via genetic fusion of rpoD to rpoC (encoding {$\sigma$}70 and RNAP's {$\beta{'}$} subunit, respectively) yields viable Escherichia coli strains in which alternative {$\sigma$}-factor function is not impaired. {$\beta{'}$}::{$\sigma$}70 RNAP transcribed DNA normally in vitro, but allowed {$\sigma$}70-dependent pausing at extended -10-like sequences anywhere in a transcriptional unit. Based on measurement of the effective concentration of tethered {$\sigma$}70, we conclude that the effective concentration of {$\sigma$}70 in E. coli (i.e., its thermodynamic activity) is close to its bulk concentration. At this level, {$\sigma$}70 would be a bona fide elongation factor able to direct transcriptional pausing even after its release from RNAP during promoter escape.},

  abstract = {Purine repressor (PurR) binding to specific DNA is enhanced by complexing with purines, whereas lactose repressor (LacI) binding is diminished by interaction with inducer sugars despite 30\% identity in their protein sequences and highly homologous tertiary structures. Nonetheless, in switching from low- to high-affinity DNA binding, these proteins undergo a similar structural change in which the hinge region connecting the DNA and effector binding domains folds into an R-helix and contacts the DNA minor groove. The differences in response to effector for these proteins should be manifest in the polyelectrolyte effect which arises from cations displaced from DNA by interaction with positively charged side chains on a protein and is quantitated by measurement of DNA binding affinity as a function of ion concentration. Consistent with structural data for these proteins, high-affinity operator DNA binding by the PurR,purine complex involved {$\sim$}15 ion pairs, a value significantly greater than that for the corresponding state of LacI ({$\sim$}6 ion pairs). For both proteins, however, conversion to the low-affinity state results in a decrease of {$\sim$}2-fold in the number of cations released per dimeric DNA binding site. Heat capacity changes ({$\increment$}Cp) that accompany DNA binding, derived from buried apolar surface area, coupled folding, and restriction of motional freedom of polar groups in the interface, also reflect the differences between these homologous repressor proteins. DNA binding of the PurR,guanine complex is accompanied by a {$\increment$}Cp (-2.8 kcal mol-1 K-1) more negative than that observed previously for LacI (-0.9 to -1.5 kcal mol-1 K-1), suggesting that more extensive protein folding and/or enhanced structural rigidity may occur upon DNA binding for PurR compared to DNA binding for LacI. The differences between these proteins illustrate plasticity of function despite high-level sequence and structural homology and undermine efforts to predict protein behavior on the basis of such similarities.},

However, the mechanism by which cytoplasmic MreB is linked to extracytoplasmic cell wall synthesis and the function of this linkage for morphogenesis has remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that the transmembrane protein RodZ mediates MreB rotation by directly or indirectly coupling MreB to cell wall synthesis enzymes. Furthermore, we map the RodZ domains that link MreB to cell wall synthesis and identify mreB mutants that suppress the shape defect of {$\Delta$}rodZ without restoring rotation, uncoupling rotation from rod-like growth. Surprisingly, MreB rotation is dispensable for rod-like shape determination under standard laboratory conditions but is required for the robustness of rod shape and growth under conditions of cell wall stress.},

Precision measurements using a host of different techniques including fluorescence and sequencing readouts have raised the bar for what it means to quantitatively understand transcriptional regulation. In particular our understanding of the simplest genetic circuit is sufficiently refined both experimentally and theoretically that it has become possible to carefully discriminate between different conceptual pictures of how this regulatory system works. This regulatory motif, originally posited by Jacob and Monod in the 1960s, consists of a single transcriptional repressor binding to a promoter site and inhibiting transcription. In this paper, we show how seven distinct models of this so-called simple-repression motif, based both on equilibrium and kinetic thinking, can be used to derive the predicted levels of gene expression and shed light on the often surprising past success of the equilibrium models. These different models are then invoked to confront a variety of different data on mean, variance and full gene expression distributions, illustrating the extent to which such models can and cannot be distinguished, and suggesting a two-state model with a distribution of burst sizes as the most potent of the seven for describing the simple-repression motif.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

By modulating a single growth parameter\textemdash extracellular pH\textemdash we discovered a subset of these so-called `redundant' enzymes in Escherichia coli are required for maximal fitness across pH environments. Among these pH specialists are the class A penicillin binding proteins PBP1a and PBP1b; defects in these enzymes attenuate growth in alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Genetic, biochemical, and cytological studies demonstrate that synthase activity is required for cell wall integrity across a wide pH range and influences pH-dependent changes in resistance to cell wall active antibiotics. Altogether, our findings reveal previously thought to be redundant enzymes are instead specialized for distinct environmental niches. This specialization may ensure robust growth and cell wall integrity in a wide range of conditions.

  abstract = {In calcareous watersheds, groundwater alkalinity results largely from dissolution of carbonate minerals in soils. The alkalinity increases initially approximately in proportion to nitrate (NO3-) concentration and eventually approaches an apparent maximum of approximately 8~mmol~L-1 at high NO3- concentrations. This close positive relationship between alkalinity and NO3- concentration appears to be predominantly a result of three processes: (i) mineralization of organic nitrogen fertilizer, (ii) exchange of OH- and H+ during the uptake of NO3- or ammonium by crop plants, and (iii) CO2 released by roots as a result of fertilizer-stimulated plant growth. We suggest that the asymptotic approach to a maximum groundwater alkalinity at NO3- concentrations exceeding 0.25~mmol~L-1 may be caused by (i) a maximum possible areal crop production at excessive N fertilization and (ii) an increasing CO2 loss to the atmosphere due to the increasing CO2 production in the soil. Our analysis provides a general understanding and quantitative prediction of steady-state groundwater NO3- concentration, alkalinity, pH, the degree of CO2 supersaturation in the soil, and soil CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. The positive correlation between alkalinity and NO3- concentration observed in groundwaters persists in rivers and lakes. We conclude that an economically efficient agricultural practice that avoids over-fertilization might accelerate the in-soil carbonate weathering rate up to approximately threefold compared to unfertilized soils, but it will not jeopardize the use of aquifers for drinking water.},

A multidisciplinary approach, involving mathematical and computational modeling in parallel with experimentation, is often crucial for gaining such insights and improving the efficiency of artificial gene network design. Here we used such an approach and developed a combinatorial promoter design strategy to characterize how the position and multiplicity of tetO2 operator sites within the GAL1 promoter affect gene expression levels and gene expression noise in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed stronger transcriptional repression and higher gene expression noise as a single operator site was moved closer to the TATA box, whereas for multiple operator-containing promoters, we found that the position and number of operator sites together determined the dose\textendash response curve and gene expression noise. We developed a generic computational model that captured the experimentally observed differences for each of the promoters, and more detailed models to successively predict the behavior of multiple operator-containing promoters from single operator-containing promoters. Our results suggest that the independent binding of single repressors is not sufficient to explain the more complex behavior of the multiple operator-containing promoters. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of joint experimental\textendash computational efforts and some of the challenges of using a bottom-up approach based on well characterized, isolated biomolecular components for predicting the behavior of complex, synthetic gene networks, e.g., the whole can be different from the sum of its parts.},

  abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has provided a myriad of applications for biological systems1. Over the last several years, mutagenesis studies have improved folding properties of GFP (refs 1,2). However, slow maturation is still a big obstacle to the use of GFP variants for visualization. These problems are exacerbated when GFP variants are expressed at 37\textdegree C and/or targeted to certain organelles. Thus, obtaining GFP variants that mature more efficiently is crucial for the development of expanded research applications. Among Aequorea GFP variants, yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) are relatively acid-sensitive, and uniquely quenched by chloride ion (Cl-)3. For YFP to be fully and stably fluorescent, mutations that decrease the sensitivity to both pH and Cl- are desired. Here we describe the development of an improved version of YFP named ``Venus''. Venus contains a novel mutation, F46L, which at 37\textdegree C greatly accelerates oxidation of the chromophore, the rate-limiting step of maturation. As a result of other mutations, F64L/M153T/V163A/S175G, Venus folds well and is relatively tolerant of exposure to acidosis and Cl-. We succeeded in efficiently targeting a neuropeptide Y-Venus fusion protein to the dense-core granules of PC12 cells. Its secretion was readily monitored by measuring release of fluorescence into the medium. The use of Venus as an acceptor allowed early detection of reliable signals of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for Ca2+ measurements in brain slices. With the improved speed and efficiency of maturation and the increased resistance to environment, Venus will enable fluorescent labelings that were not possible before.},

We address this question by focusing on starvation response in sporulating Bacillus subtilis. We show that the activity of sporulation master regulator Spo0A increases with decreasing cellular growth rate. Using a mathematical model of the phosphorelay?the network controlling Spo0A?we predict that this increase in Spo0A activity can be explained by the phosphorelay protein accumulation and lengthening of the period between chromosomal replication events caused by growth slowdown. As a result, only cells growing slower than a certain rate reach threshold Spo0A activity necessary for sporulation. This growth threshold model accurately predicts cell fates and explains the distribution of sporulation deferral times. We confirm our predictions experimentally and show that the concentration rather than activity of phosphorelay proteins is affected by the growth slowdown. We conclude that sensing the growth rates enables cells to indirectly detect starvation without the need for evaluating specific stress signals.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: A fundamental clinical and scientific concern is how lytic bacteriophage, as well as antibiotics, impact diagnostic positivity. Methods: Cholera was chosen as a model disease to investigate this important question. Patients with diarrheal disease were enrolled at two remote hospitals in Bangladesh. Diagnostic performance was assessed as a function of lytic bacteriophage detection, as well as exposure to the first-line antibiotic azithromycin detected by mass spectrometry. Results: Among diarrheal samples positive by nanoliter quantitative PCR for Vibrio cholerae (n=78/849), the odds that a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or qPCR was positive was reduced by 89\% (OR 0.108; 95\%CI 0.002-0.872) and 87\% (OR 0.130; 95\%CI 0.022-0.649) when lytic bacteriophage were detected, respectively. The odds that a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) or qPCR was positive was reduced by more than 99\% (OR 0.00; 95\% CI: 0.00-0.28) and 89\% (OR 0.11; 95\% CI: 0.03-0.44) when azithromycin was detected, respectively. Conclusions: Estimations of cholera burden may improve by accommodating for the negative effect of antimicrobial exposure on diagnostic positivity. Furthermore, the findings herein challenge our current approach to interpreting and developing bacterial diagnostics given variable rates of lytic bacteriophage and antibiotic exposure.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We compare discriminative and generative learning as typified by logistic regression and naive Bayes. We show, contrary to a widelyheld belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation- which is borne out in repeated experiments- that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster.},

  abstract = {Mutation accumulation experiments followed by whole-genome sequencing have revealed that, for several bacterial species, the rate of base-pair substitutions (BPSs) is not constant across the chromosome but varies in a wave-like pattern that is symmetrical about the origin of replication. The experiments reported here demonstrated that, in Escherichia coli, several interacting factors determine the wave. The origin is a major driver of BPS rates. When it is relocated, the BPS rates in a 1,000-kb region surrounding the new origin reproduce the pattern that surrounds the normal origin. However, the pattern across distant regions of the chromosome is unaltered and thus must be determined by other factors. Increasing the deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) concentration shifts the wave pattern away from the origin, supporting the hypothesis that fluctuations in dNTP pools coincident with replication firing contribute to the variations in the mutation rate. The nucleoid binding proteins (HU and Fis) and the terminus organizing protein (MatP) are also major factors. These proteins alter the three-dimensional structure of the DNA, and results suggest that mutation rates increase when highly structured DNA is replicated. Biases in error correction by proofreading and mismatch repair, both of which may be responsive to dNTP concentrations and DNA structure, also are major determinants of the wave pattern. These factors should apply to most bacterial and, possibly, eukaryotic genomes and suggest that different areas of the genome evolve at different rates.},

In this review, we propose that despite their apparent differences, the copy-number control of the Escherichia coli chromosome is similar to that of plasmids. The basic mechanism that is shared by both systems is negative-feedback control of the availability of a protein or RNA positive initiator. Superimposed on this basic mechanism are at least three systems that secure the synchronous initiation of multiple origins; however, these mechanisms are not essential for maintaining the copy number.},

By creating a gene fusion between mscl and the gene encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP) we were able to express the fusion protein MscL-GFP in bacteria. We show that MscL-GFP is present in the cytoplasmic membrane and forms functional channels. These channels have the same characteristics as wild-type MscL, except that they require more pressure to open.

Metabolism and gene expression are interdependent processes that affect and constrain each other. We formalize these constraints and apply the principle of growth optimization to enable the accurate prediction of multi-scale phenotypes, ranging from coarse-grained (growth rate, nutrient uptake, by-product secretion) to fine-grained (metabolic fluxes, gene expression levels).

Expression of un-utilized protein (that have no benefits in the current environment) incurs a quantifiable fitness costs on cellular growth rates; however, the magnitude and variability of un-utilized protein expression in natural settings is unknown, largely due to the challenge in determining environment-specific proteome utilization. We address this challenge using absolute and global proteomics data combined with a recently developed genome-scale model of Escherichia coli that computes the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a per gene basis. We show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments and accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains {$>$}95\% of the variance in growth rates of Escherichia coli across 16 distinct environments. Furthermore, reduction in unused protein expression is shown to be a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. Classification of the unused protein reveals that the unused protein encodes several nutrient- and stress- preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. Thus, unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change.},

We find that cooperative repression by tetrameric Lac repressor increases with both quality and proximity of the interacting operators.

The inducer-binding affinities and association rate constants of the mutant proteins and protein-operator DNA fragment complexes are also altered compared to wild-type. The extents of these changes vary among the different mutant repressors. The nonspecific DNA-binding affinities of the mutant proteins are 2--3-fold greater than the wild-type repressor, and the affinities of the tight-binding proteins for a 29 base-pair operator DNA fragment are also increased, though to a varying extent depending upon the mutant.

These strains showed high, medium, and low resistance to pressure, respectively, in stationary phase but similar resistance to pressure in exponential phase. Loss of membrane integrity was measured as loss of osmotic responsiveness or as increased uptake of the fluorescent dye propidium iodide. In exponential-phase cells, loss of viability was correlated with a permanent loss of membrane integrity in all strains, whereas in stationary-phase cells, a more complicated picture emerged in which cell membranes became leaky during pressure treatment but resealed to a greater or lesser extent following decompression. Strain H1071 displayed a very unusual pressure response in stationary phase in which survival decreased to a minimum at 300 MPa but then increased at 400 to 500 MPa before decreasing again. Membranes were unable to reseal after treatment at 300 MPa but could do so after treatment at higher pressures. Membrane damage in this strain was thus typical of exponential-phase cells under low-pressure conditions but of stationary-phase cells under higher-pressure conditions. Heat shock treatment of strain H1071 cells increased pressure resistance under low-pressure conditions and also allowed membrane damage to reseal. Growth in the presence of IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside) increased resistance under high-pressure conditions. The mechanisms of inactivation may thus differ at high and low pressures. These studies support the view that membrane damage is an important event in the inactivation of bacteria by high pressure, but the nature of membrane damage and its relation to cell death may differ between species and phases of growth.},

  abstract = {Biological membranes are essential for cell viability. Their functional characteristics strongly depend on their protein content, which consists of transmembrane (integral) and peripherally associated membrane proteins. Both integral and peripheral inner membrane proteins mediate a plethora of biological processes. Whereas transmembrane proteins have characteristic hydrophobic stretches and can be predicted using bioinformatics approaches, peripheral inner membrane proteins are hydrophilic, exist in equilibria with soluble pools, and carry no discernible membrane targeting signals. We experimentally determined the cytoplasmic peripheral inner membrane proteome of the model organism Escherichia coli using a multidisciplinary approach. Initially, we extensively re-annotated the theoretical proteome regarding subcellular localization using literature searches, manual curation, and multi-combinatorial bioinformatics searches of the available databases. Next we used sequential biochemical fractionations coupled to direct identification of individual proteins and protein complexes using high resolution mass spectrometry. We determined that the proposed cytoplasmic peripheral inner membrane proteome occupies a previously unsuspected {$\sim$}19\% of the basic E. coli BL21(DE3) proteome, and the detected peripheral inner membrane proteome occupies {$\sim$}25\% of the estimated expressed proteome of this cell grown in LB medium to mid-log phase. This value might increase when fleeting interactions, not studied here, are taken into account. Several proteins previously regarded as exclusively cytoplasmic bind membranes avidly. Many of these proteins are organized in functional or/and structural oligomeric complexes that bind to the membrane with multiple interactions. Identified proteins cover the full spectrum of biological activities, and more than half of them are essential. Our data suggest that the cytoplasmic proteome displays remarkably dynamic and extensive communication with biological membrane surfaces that we are only beginning to decipher.},

The standard theory of this phenomenon neglects the occurrence of multiple mutations as well as the correlation between loss by genetic drift and clonal competition, which is questionable in large populations. Working within the Wright\textendash Fisher model with multiplicative fitness (no epistasis), we determine the rate of adaptation asymptotically for very large population sizes and show that the standard theory fails in this regime. Our study also explains the success of the standard theory in predicting the rate of adaptation for moderately large populations. Furthermore, we show that the nature of the substitution process changes qualitatively when multiple mutations are allowed for, because several mutations can be fixed in a single fixation event. As a consequence, the index of dispersion for counts of the fixation process displays a minimum as a function of population size, whereas the origination process of fixed mutations becomes completely regular for very large populations. We find that the number of mutations fixed in a single event is geometrically distributed as in the neutral case. These conclusions are based on extensive simulations combined with analytic results for the limit of infinite population size.},

However, such trade can also cause social, environmental and economic impacts beyond the limits of the countries directly involved in the exchange. Agricultural systems are telecoupled because the impacts caused by trade can generate important feedback loops, spillovers, rebound effects, time lags and non-linearities across multiple geographical and temporal scales that make these impacts more difficult to identify and mitigate. We make a comparative review of current impact assessment methods to analyze their suitability to assess the impacts of telecoupled agricultural supply chains. Given the large impacts caused by agricultural production on land systems, we focus on the capacity of methods to account for and spatially allocate direct and indirect land use change. Our analysis identifies trade-offs between methods with respect to the elements of the telecoupled system they address. Hybrid methods are a promising field to navigate these trade-offs. Knowledge gaps in assessing indirect land use change should be overcome in order to improve the accuracy of assessments.},

Although RNA polymerase is largely confined to the nucleoid, it is difficult to determine absolute concentrations of [Rf] at particular locations within the nucleoid structure. However, relative concentrations of free RNA polymerase at different growth rates, [Rf]rel, can be estimated from the activities of constitutive promoters. Previous studies indicated that the rrnB P2 promoter is constitutive and that [Rf]rel in the vicinity of rrnB P2 increases with increasing growth rate. Recently it has become possible to directly visualize Rf in growing Escherichia coli cells. Here we examine some of the important issues relating to gene expression based on these new observations. We conclude that: (i) At a growth rate of 2 doublings/h, there are about 1000 free and 2350 non-specifically DNA-bound RNA polymerase molecules per average cell (12 and 28\%, respectively, of 8400 total) which are in rapid equilibrium. (ii) The reversibility of the non-specific binding generates more than 1000 free RNA polymerase molecules every second in the immediate vicinity of the DNA. Of these, most rebind non-specifically to the DNA within a few ms; the frequency of non-specific binding is at least two orders of magnitude greater than specific binding and transcript initiation. (iii) At a given amount of RNA polymerase per cell, [Rf] and the density of non-specifically DNA-bound RNA polymerase molecules along the DNA both vary reciprocally with the amount of DNA in the cell. (iv) At 2 doublings/h an E. coli cell contains, on the average, about 1 non-specifically bound RNA polymerase per 9 kbp of DNA and 1 free RNA polymerase per 20 kbp of DNA. However some DNA regions (i.e. near active rRNA operons) may have significantly higher than average [Rf].},

Hence, the cell needs robust peptidoglycan growth mechanisms to grow and divide under different conditions. Here we propose a model according to which the cell achieves robust peptidoglycan growth by employing dynamic multi-protein complexes, which assemble with variable composition from freely diffusing sets of peptidoglycan synthases, hydrolases and their regulators, whereby the composition of the active complexes depends on the cell cycle state \textendash{} cell elongation or division \textendash{} and the periplasmic growth conditions.},

The fluorescence of \emph{Escherichia coli} cells expressing each of eighteen proteins from Pyrobaculum aerophilum as fusions with superfolder GFP was proportional to total protein expression. In contrast, fluorescence of folding reporter GFP fusion proteins was strongly correlated with the productive folding yield of the passenger protein.

But biochemical events do not necessarily occur in single steps of individual molecules. Some processes are greatly randomized when synthesis or degradation occurs in large bursts of many molecules during a short time interval. Conversely, each birth or death of a macromolecule could involve several small steps, creating a memory between individual events. We present a generalized theory for stochastic gene expression, formulating the variance in protein abundance in terms of the randomness of the individual gene expression events. We show that common types of molecular mechanisms can produce gestation and senescence periods that reduce noise without requiring higher abundances, shorter lifetimes, or any concentration-dependent control loops. We also show that most single-cell experimental methods cannot distinguish between qualitatively different stochastic principles, although this in turn makes such methods better suited for identifying which components introduce fluctuations. Characterizing the random events that give rise to noise in concentrations instead requires dynamic measurements with single-molecule resolution.},

One key parameter is the effect of a new mutation on fitness, which invariably depends on the environment and genetic background. The fate of a mutation also depends on population size, which determines the amount of drift it will experience. Here, we manipulate both population size and genotype composition and follow adaptation of 23 distinct Escherichia coli genotypes. These have previously accumulated mutations under intense genetic drift and encompass a substantial fitness variation. A simple rule is uncovered: the net fitness change is negatively correlated with the fitness of the genotype in which new mutations appear\textemdash a signature of epistasis. We find that Fisher's geometrical model can account for the observed patterns of fitness change and infer the parameters of this model that best fit the data, using Approximate Bayesian Computation. We estimate a genomic mutation rate of 0.01 per generation for fitness altering mutations, albeit with a large confidence interval, a mean fitness effect of mutations of -0.01, and an effective number of traits nine in mutS- E. coli. This framework can be extended to confront a broader range of models with data and test different classes of fitness landscape models.},

If so, the theoretical tools needed to quantitatively and predictively describe what goes on in such test tubes lag sorely behind the stunning experimental advances in biology seen in the decades since the molecular biology revolution began. Perhaps surprisingly, one of the theoretical tools that has been used with great success on problems ranging from how cells communicate with their environment and each other to the nature of the organization of proteins and lipids within the cell membrane is statistical mechanics. A knee-jerk reaction to the use of statistical mechanics in the description of cellular processes is that living organisms are so far from equilibrium that one has no business even thinking about it. But such reactions are probably too hasty given that there are many regimes in which, because of a separation of timescales, for example, such an approach can be a useful first step. In this article, we explore the power of statistical mechanical thinking in the biological setting, with special emphasis on cell signaling and regulation. We show how such models are used to make predictions and describe some recent experiments designed to test them. We also consider the limits of such models based on the relative timescales of the processes of interest.},

Nonetheless, there is an Achilles' heel exposed by all of the genomic data that has accrued: We still do not know how to interpret them. Many genes are subject to sophisticated programs of transcriptional regulation, mediated by DNA sequences that harbor binding sites for transcription factors, which can up- or down-regulate gene expression depending upon environmental conditions. This gives rise to an input\textendash output function describing how the level of expression depends upon the parameters of the regulated gene\textemdash for instance, on the number and type of binding sites in its regulatory sequence. In recent years, the ability to make precision measurements of expression, coupled with the ability to make increasingly sophisticated theoretical predictions, has enabled an explicit dialogue between theory and experiment that holds the promise of covering this genomic Achilles' heel. The goal is to reach a predictive understanding of transcriptional regulation that makes it possible to calculate gene expression levels from DNA regulatory sequence. This review focuses on the canonical simple repression motif to ask how well the models that have been used to characterize it actually work. We consider a hierarchy of increasingly sophisticated experiments in which the minimal parameter set learned at one level is applied to make quantitative predictions at the next. We show that these careful quantitative dissections provide a template for a predictive understanding of the many more complex regulatory arrangements found across all domains of life.},

The difference in the concentration of chemicals in a bacterium's cytoplasm and the external environment generates an osmotic pressure that inflates the cell. It is thought that the bacterium Escherichia coli use a number of interconnected systems to adapt to changes in external pressure, allowing them to maintain turgor and live in surroundings that range more than two-hundred-fold in external osmolality. Here, we use fluorescence imaging to make the first measurements of cell volume changes over time during hyperosmotic shock and subsequent adaptation on a single cell level in vivo with a time resolution on the order of seconds. We directly observe two previously unseen phases of the cytoplasmic water efflux upon hyperosmotic shock. Furthermore, we monitor cell volume changes during the post-shock recovery and observe a two-phase response that depends on the shock magnitude. The initial phase of recovery is fast, on the order of 15\textendash 20 min and shows little cell-to-cell variation. For large sucrose shocks, a secondary phase that lasts several hours adds to the recovery. We find that cells are able to recover fully from shocks as high as 1 Osmol/kg using existing systems, but that for larger shocks, protein synthesis is required for full recovery.},

After recovery, and if the external osmolality remains high, cells have been shown to grow more slowly, smaller, and at reduced turgor pressure. Despite the fact that the active recovery is a key stress response, the nature of these changes and how they relate to each other is not understood. Here, we use fluorescence imaging of single cells during hyperosmotic shocks, combined with custom made microfluidic devices, to show that cells fully recover their volume to the initial, preshock value and continue to grow at a slower rate immediately after the recovery. We show that the cell envelope material properties do not change after hyperosmotic shock, and that cell shape recovers along with cell volume. Taken together, these observations indicate that the turgor pressure recovers to its initial value so that reduced turgor is not responsible for the reduced growth rate observed immediately after recovery. To determine the point at which the reduction in cell size and turgor pressure occurs after shock, we measured the volume of E.~coli cells at different stages of growth in bulk cultures. We show that cell volume reaches the same maximal level irrespective of the osmolality of the media. Based on these measurements, we propose that turgor pressure is used as a feedback variable for osmoregulatory pumps instead of being directly responsible for the reduction in growth rates. Reestablishment of turgor to its initial value might ensure correct attachment of the inner membrane and cell wall needed for cell wall biosynthesis.},

CrCAX1 was more closely related to fungal cation exchanger (CAX) genes than those from higher plants but has structural characteristics similar to plant Ca2+/H+ exchangers including a long N-terminal tail. When CrCAX1-GFP was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it localized at the vacuole. CrCAX1 could suppress the Ca2+-hypersensitive phenotype of a yeast mutant and mediated proton gradient-dependent Ca2+/H+ exchange activity in vacuolar membrane vesicles. Ca2+ transport activity was increased following N-terminal truncation of CrCAX1, suggesting the existence of an N-terminal auto-regulatory mechanism. CrCAX1 could also provide tolerance to Na+ stress when expressed in yeast or Arabidopsis thaliana because of Na+/H+ exchange activity. This Na+/H+ exchange activity was not regulated by the N terminus of the CrCAX1 protein. A subtle tolerance by CrCAX1 in yeast to Co2+ stress was also observed. CrCAX1 was transcriptionally regulated in Chlamydomonas cells grown in elevated Ca2+ or Na+. This study has thus uncovered a novel eukaryotic proton-coupled transporter, CrCAX1, that can transport both monovalent and divalent cations and that appears to play a role in cellular cation homeostasis by the transport of Ca2+ and Na+ into the vacuole.},

  abstract = {Mechanosensitive (MS) channels that provide protection against hypoosmotic shock are found in the membranes of organisms from the three domains of life: bacteria, archaea, and eucarya. Two families of ubiquitous MS channels are recognized, and these have been designated the MscL and MscS families. A high-resolution X-ray crystallographic structure is available for a member of the MscL family, and extensive molecular genetic, biophysical, and biochemical studies conducted in many laboratories have allowed postulation of a gating mechanism allowing the interconversion of a tightly closed state and an open state that controls transmembrane ion and metabolite fluxes. In contrast to the MscL channel proteins, which are of uniform topology, the much larger MscS family includes protein members with topologies that are predicted to vary from 3 to 11 alpha-helical transmembrane segments (TMSs) per polypeptide chain. Sequence analyses reveal that the three C-terminal TMSs of MscS channel proteins are conserved among family members and that the third of these three TMSs exhibits a 20-residue motif that is shared by the channel-forming TMS (TMS 1) of the MscL proteins. We propose that this C-terminal TMS in MscS family homologues serves as the channel-forming helix in a homooligomeric structure. The presence of a conserved residue pattern for the putative channel-forming TMSs in the MscL and MscS family proteins suggests a common structural organization, gating mechanism, and evolutionary origin.},

Here, we show that a gene regulation system evolves to the optimal regulatory response when challenged with variable environments. We engineered a genetic module subject to regulation by the lac repressor (LacI) in E.~coli, whose expression is beneficial in one environmental condition and detrimental in another. Measured tradeoffs in fitness between environments predict the competition between regulatory phenotypes. We show that regulatory evolution in adverse environments is delayed at specific boundaries in the phenotype space of the regulatory LacI protein. Once this constraint is relieved by mutation, adaptation proceeds toward the optimum, yielding LacI with an altered allosteric mechanism that enables an opposite response to its regulatory ligand IPTG. Our results indicate that regulatory evolution can be understood in terms of tradeoff optimization theory.},

These strains were submitted to a final water potential of -107.2 MPa, -170.9 MPa and/or -244.7 MPa. In any case the kinetics of water potential variation was found to have a great effect on the cell viability. The application of slow water potential decreases could maintain an important cell viability (about 80-100\%) with regard to the corresponding viability observed after a sudden step change for the same final water potential (15-57\%). For each strain tested, an optimal dehydration kinetics was determined which depended on the final water potential. The existence of this optimum could be explained thanks to the opposition of two actions affecting cell viability: a positive action relative to the slowness of the water potential variation and a negative action relative to the residence time of cells in a critical range of water potential.},

The water potential decrease was realized either rapidly (osmotic shock) or slowly (20 min) and a difference in cell viability between these conditions was only observed when the solute was NaCl. The cell mortality during osmotic shocks induced by NaCl cannot be explained by a critical volume decrease or by the intensity of the water flow across the cell membrane. When the osmotic stress is realized with NaCl as the solute, in a medium in which osmoregulation cannot take place, the application of a slow decrease in water potential resulted in the significant maintenance of cell viability (about 70-90\%) with regard to the corresponding viability observed after a sudden step change to same final water potential (14-40\%).

  abstract = {Trp fluorescence spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study the structures of membrane proteins and their interactions with the surrounding lipid bilayer. Many membrane proteins contain more than one Trp residue, making analysis of the fluorescence data more complex. The mechanosensitive channels MscL's of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TbMscL) and \emph{Escherichia coli} (EcMscL) contain no Trp residues. We have therefore introduced single Trp residues into the transmembrane regions of TbMscL and EcMscL to give the Trp-containing mutants F80W-TbMscL and F93W-EcMscL, respectively, which we show are highly suitable for measurements of lipid binding constants. In vivo cell viability assays in \emph{E. coli} show that introduction of the Trp residues does not block function of the channels. The Trp-containing mutants have been reconstituted into lipid bilayers by mixing in cholate followed by dilution to re-form membranes. Cross-linking experiments suggest that the proteins retain their pentameric structures in phosphatidylcholines with chain lengths between C14 and C24, phosphatidylserines, and phosphatidic acid. Quenching of Trp fluorescence by brominated phospholipids suggests that the Trp residue in F80W-TbMscL is more exposed to the lipid bilayer than the Trp residue in F93W-EcMscL. Binding constants for phosphatidylcholines change with changing fatty acyl chain length, the strongest interaction for both TbMscL and EcMscL being observed with a chain of length C16, corresponding to a bilayer of hydrophobic thickness ca. 24 A, compared to a hydrophobic thickness for TbMscL of about 26 A estimated from the crystal structure. Lipid binding constants change by only a factor of 1.5 in the chain length range from C12 to C24, much less than expected from theories of hydrophobic mismatch in which the protein is treated as a rigid body. It is concluded that MscL distorts to match changes in bilayer thickness. The binding constants for dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine for both TbMscL and EcMscL relative to those for dioleoylphosphatidylcholine are close to 1. Quenching experiments suggest a single class of binding sites for phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cardiolipin on TbMscL; binding constants are greater than those for phosphatidylcholine and decrease with increasing ionic strength, suggesting that charge interactions are important in binding these anionic phospholipids. Quenching experiments suggest two classes of lipid binding sites on TbMscL for phosphatidic acid, binding of phosphatidic acid being much less dependent on ionic strength than binding of phosphatidylserine.},

  abstract = {Degradation of the general stress sigma factor sigmaS of \emph{Escherichia coli} is a prime example of regulated proteolysis in prokaryotes. Whereas exponentially growing cells rapidly degrade sigmaS, various stress conditions result in stabilization and, therefore, rapid accumulation of sigmaS. Proteolysis of sigmaS requires the response regulator RssB, a direct recognition factor with phosphorylation-dependent affinity for sigmaS, which targets sigmaS to the ClpXP protease. Here, we demonstrate that a sudden increase in sigmaS synthesis results in sigmaS stabilization, indicating titration of an essential proteolytic component. Evidence is provided that RssB is the overall rate-limiting factor for sigmaS proteolysis. As a consequence, the cell has to continuously adjust the expression of RssB to sigmaS in order to maintain sigmaS proteolysis in growing cells, despite variations in the rate of sigmaS synthesis. Such homeostatic feedback-coupling is provided by rssB transcription being dependent on the sigmaS-controlled rssAB operon promoter. However, strong and rapid increases in sigmaS synthesis, in re-sponse to acute stress, exceed the compensatory potential of this feedback loop with the result that sigmaS is stabilized because of RssB titration. We propose that RssB control of sigmaS proteolysis functions as a genetic switch, in which (i) the 'off' state (low sigmaS levels caused by proteolysis) is stabilized by a homeostatic negative feedback, and (ii) the threshold for switching to the 'on' state (high levels of stable sigmaS) is dependent on the cellular level of active, i.e. phosphorylated RssB.},

Here, we show that adaptation to a physiologically distinct class of ligand specificity in a PSD95, DLG1, ZO-1 (PDZ) domain preferentially occurs through class-bridging intermediate mutations located distant from the ligand-binding site. These mutations provide a functional link between ligand classes and demonstrate the principle of ``conditional neutrality'' in mediating evolutionary adaptation. Structures show that class-bridging mutations work allosterically to open up conformational plasticity at the active site, permitting novel functions while retaining existing function. More generally, the class-bridging phenotype arises from mutations in an evolutionarily conserved network of coevolving amino acids in the PDZ family (the sector) that connects the active site to distant surface sites. These findings introduce the concept that allostery in proteins could have its origins not in protein function but in the capacity to adapt.},

  abstract = {Increasing demands for petroleum have stimulated sustainable ways to produce chemicals and biofuels. Specifically, fatty acids of varying chain lengths (C6\textendash C16) naturally synthesized in many organisms are promising starting points for the catalytic production of industrial chemicals and diesel-like biofuels. However, bio-production of fatty acids from plants and other microbial production hosts relies heavily on manipulating tightly regulated fatty acid biosynthetic pathways. In addition, precursors for fatty acids are used along other central metabolic pathways for the production of amino acids and biomass, which further complicates the engineering of microbial hosts for higher yields. Here, we demonstrate an iterative metabolic engineering effort that integrates computationally driven predictions and metabolic flux analysis techniques to meet this challenge. The OptForce procedure was used for suggesting and prioritizing genetic manipulations that overproduce fatty acids of different chain lengths from C6 to C16 starting with wild-type E. coli. We identified some common but mostly chain-specific genetic interventions alluding to the possibility of fine-tuning overproduction for specific fatty acid chain lengths. In accordance with the OptForce prioritization of interventions, fabZ and acyl-ACP thioesterase were upregulated and fadD was deleted to arrive at a strain that produces 1.70g/L and 0.14g fatty acid/g glucose ({$\sim$}39\% maximum theoretical yield) of C14\textendash 16 fatty acids in minimal M9 medium. These results highlight the benefit of using computational strain design and flux analysis tools in the design of recombinant strains of E. coli to produce free fatty acids.},

This natural variability in populations fuels many fundamental biological processes, ranging from evolutionary adaptation and speciation to the spread of genetic diseases and drug resistance. An interesting and important component of this variability is present within the regulatory regions of genes. As these regions evolve, accumulated mutations lead to modulation of gene expression, which may have consequences for the phenotype. A simple model system where the link between genetic variability, gene regulation and function can be studied in detail is missing. In this article we develop a model to explore how the sequence of the wild-type lac promoter dictates the fold change in gene expression. The model combines single-base pair resolution maps of transcription factor and RNA polymerase binding energies with a comprehensive thermodynamic model of gene regulation. The model was validated by predicting and then measuring the variability of lac operon regulation in a collection of natural isolates. We then implement the model to analyze the sensitivity of the promoter sequence to the regulatory output, and predict the potential for regulation to evolve due to point mutations promoter region.},

  abstract = {Allosteric regulation is found across all domains of life, yet we still lack simple, predictive theories that directly link the experimentally tunable parameters of a system to its input-output response. To that end, we present a general theory of allosteric transcriptional regulation using the Monod-WymanChangeux model. We rigorously test this model using the ubiquitous simple repression motif in bacteria by first predicting the behavior of strains that span a large range of repressor copy numbers and DNA binding strengths and then constructing and measuring their response. Our model not only accurately captures the induction profiles of these strains, but also enables us to derive analytic expressions for key properties such as the dynamic range and [EC50]. Finally, we derive an expression for the free energy of allosteric repressors that enables us to collapse our experimental data onto a single master curve that captures the diverse phenomenology of the induction profiles.},

  abstract = {Forking Replisomes
Replisomes are multiprotein machines that replicate DNA. Significant insight into how they work comes from in vitro studies, but how replisomes are organized in living cells has remained unclear. Reyes-Lamothe et al. (p. 498) have watched the replisome in living Escherichia coli cells using single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy with millisecond time resolution. Cells expressing fluorescent derivatives of 10 different replisome components revealed both the stoichiometry and spatial distribution of the components at active replication forks in Escherichia coli. A similar technique could be used to study other molecular machines as they function.
The multiprotein replisome complex that replicates DNA has been extensively characterized in vitro, but its composition and architecture in vivo is unknown. Using millisecond single-molecule fluorescence microscopy in living cells expressing fluorescent derivatives of replisome components, we have examined replisome stoichiometry and architecture. Active Escherichia coli replisomes contain three molecules of the replicative polymerase, rather than the historically accepted two. These are associated with three molecules of {$\tau$}, a clamp loader component that trimerizes polymerase. Only two of the three sliding clamps are always associated with the core replisome. Single-strand binding protein has a broader spatial distribution than the core components, with 5 to 11 tetramers per replisome. This in vivo technique could provide single-molecule insight into other molecular machines.
Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy reveals the organization of the replisome in living bacterial cells.

These networks, termed sectors, are spatially organized such that active sites are linked to many surface sites distributed throughout the structure. Using the metabolic enzyme dihydrofolate reductase as a model system, we show that: (1) the sector is strongly correlated to a network of residues undergoing millisecond conformational fluctuations associated with enzyme catalysis, and (2) sector-connected surface sites are statistically preferred locations for the emergence of allosteric control in vivo. Thus, sectors represent an evolutionarily conserved ``wiring'' mechanism that can enable perturbations at specific surface positions to rapidly initiate conformational control over protein function. These findings suggest that sectors enable the evolution of intermolecular communication and regulation.},

With estimated standing populations of 1.43 billion cattle, 1.87 billion sheep and goats, 0.98 billion pigs, and 19.60 billion chickens, reliable and accessible information on the distribution and abundance of livestock is needed for a many reasons. These include analyses of the social and economic aspects of the livestock sector; the environmental impacts of livestock such as the production and management of waste, greenhouse gas emissions and livestock-related land-use change; and large-scale public health and epidemiological investigations. The Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) database, produced in 2007, provided modelled livestock densities of the world, adjusted to match official (FAOSTAT) national estimates for the reference year 2005, at a spatial resolution of 3 minutes of arc (about 5\texttimes 5 km at the equator). Recent methodological improvements have significantly enhanced these distributions: more up-to date and detailed sub-national livestock statistics have been collected; a new, higher resolution set of predictor variables is used; and the analytical procedure has been revised and extended to include a more systematic assessment of model accuracy and the representation of uncertainties associated with the predictions. This paper describes the current approach in detail and presents new global distribution maps at 1 km resolution for cattle, pigs and chickens, and a partial distribution map for ducks. These digital layers are made publically available via the Livestock Geo-Wiki (http://www.livestock.geo-wiki.org), as will be the maps of other livestock types as they are produced.},

Furthermore, the method can simultaneously track particles of all different sizes, and allows significant freedom in their shape. The algorithm is evaluated using the quantitative measures of accuracy and precision of previous authors, using simulated images at variable signal-to-noise ratios. To these we add new tests: the error due to a non-uniform background, and the error due to two particles approaching each other. Finally the tracking of particles in real cell images is demonstrated. The method is made freely available for non-commercial use as a software package with a graphical user-interface, which can be run within the Matlab programming environment.},

Elucidating the sequence\textendash function relationship of promoters is crucial for manipulating gene expression at the transcriptional level, particularly for inducible systems dependent on transcriptional regulators. Sort-seq methods employing fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and high-throughput sequencing allow for the quantitative analysis of sequence\textendash function relationships in a robust and rapid way. Here we utilized a massively parallel sort-seq approach to analyze the formaldehyde-inducible Escherichia coli promoter (Pfrm) with single-nucleotide resolution. A library of mutated formaldehyde-inducible promoters was cloned upstream of gfp on a plasmid. The library was partitioned into bins via FACS on the basis of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression level, and mutated promoters falling into each expression bin were identified with high-throughput sequencing. The resulting analysis identified two 19 base pair repressor binding sites, one upstream of the -35 RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding site and one overlapping with the -10 site, and assessed the relative importance of each position and base therein. Key mutations were identified for tuning expression levels and were used to engineer formaldehyde-inducible promoters with predictable activities. Engineered variants demonstrated up to 14-fold lower basal expression, 13-fold higher induced expression, and a 3.6-fold stronger response as indicated by relative dynamic range. Finally, an engineered formaldehyde-inducible promoter was employed to drive the expression of heterologous methanol assimilation genes and achieved increased biomass levels on methanol, a non-native substrate of E. coli.},

The change in turgor pressure resulting from an osmotic shock alters the mechanical forces within the cell envelope, and can impact cell growth across a range of timescales, through a variety of mechanical mechanisms. Here, we first summarize measurements of turgor pressure in various organisms. We then review how the combination of microfluidic flow cells and quantitative image analysis has driven discovery of the diverse ways in which turgor pressure mechanically regulates bacterial growth, independent of the effect of cytoplasmic crowding. In Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria, reductions in turgor pressure cause decreased growth rate. Moreover, a hypoosmotic shock, which increases turgor pressure and membrane tension, leads to transient inhibition of cell-wall growth via electrical depolarization. By contrast, Gram-negative Escherichia coli is remarkably insensitive to changes in turgor. We discuss the extent to which turgor pressure impacts processes such as cell division that alter cell shape, in particular that turgor facilitates millisecond-scale daughter-cell separation in many Actinobacteria and eukaryotic fission yeast. This diverse set of responses showcases the potential for using osmotic shocks to interrogate how mechanical perturbations affect cellular processes.},

The other system, PST, was repressible by phosphate concentrations above 1 mM, required the phosphate-binding protein for full activity, and did not operate in spheroplasts. It catalyzed very little exchange between internal and external phosphate and was resistant to uncouplers. The maximal velocities attained by the two systems were approximately the same, but the affinity for phosphate in the PST system was greater by two orders of magnitude.

Here we employ synthetic gene circuits in \emph{Escherichia coli} to measure the rise-times of non-self-regulated and of negatively autoregulated transcription units. Non-self-regulated units have a rise-time of one cell-cycle. We demonstrate experimentally that negative autoregulation feedback (also termed autogenous control) reduces the rise-time to about one fifth of a cell-cycle. This agrees with an analytical solution of a mathematical model for negative autoregulation. This may help in understanding the function of negative autoregulation, which appears in over 40\% of known transcription factors in E.coli.},

Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter PR in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.

  abstract = {Quantitative in vivo measurements are essential for developing a predictive understanding of cellular behavior. Here we present a technique that converts observed fluorescence intensities into numbers of molecules. By transiently expressing a fluorescently tagged protein and then following its dilution during growth and division, we observe asymmetric partitioning of fluorescence between daughter cells at each division. Such partition asymmetries are set by the actual numbers of proteins present, and thus provide a means to quantify fluorescence levels. We present a Bayesian algorithm that infers from such data both the fluorescence conversion factor and an estimate of the measurement error. Our algorithm works for arbitrarily sized data sets and handles consistently any missing measurements. We verify the algorithm with extensive simulation and demonstrate its application to experimental data from Escherichia coli. Our technique should provide a quantitative internal calibration to systems biology studies of both synthetic and endogenous cellular networks.},

In one population, three clones were isolated and by means of reconstruction experiments were shown to be maintained in stable polymorphism, although they exhibited substantial differences in maximum specific growth rates and in glucose uptake kinetics. Analysis of these three clones revealed that their stable coexistence could be explained by differential patterns of the secretion and uptake of two alternative metabolites acetate and glycerol. Regulatory (constitutive and null) mutations in acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase accounted for different patterns of acetate secretion and uptake seen. Altered patterns in glycerol uptake are most likely explained by mutations which result in quantitative differences in the induction of the glycerol regulon and/or structural changes in glycerol kinase that reduce allosteric inhibition by effector molecules associated with glycolysis. The evolution of resource partitioning, and consequent polymorphisms which arise may illustrate incipient processes of speciation in asexual organisms.},

  abstract = {Although worldwide loss of biodiversity arising from human activities is widely known, policy has been unable to arrest the decline (1). Much of this failure can be attributed to a lack of mainstreaming of biodiversity in public policy (2, pp. 741\textendash 762) and limitations in raising the profile of biodiversity loss for politicians and the public. Of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets (ABTs) established in 2010 by the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), only four show good progress, whereas 12 related to the state of nature show worsening trends (1). With the 2020 target date for the ABTs now upon us, it is critical to define a post-2020 agenda to arrest the loss of biodiversity. This will require a target, underpinned by a clear global goal for biodiversity, that can be readily communicated to galvanize both political will and public support. Similarly to how the climate change community uses a single indicator (global mean temperature change) and a target (maximum 2\textdegree C rise relative to preindustrial levels) as a rallying point for policy action and agreements, we propose a 2\textdegree C-like target for biodiversity (see table S1): a measurable, near-term target of keeping described species extinctions to well below 20 per year over the next 100 years across all major groups (fungi, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates) and across all ecosystem types (marine, freshwater, and terrestrial).

Quantitative methods to monitor MurJ activity are required to characterize inhibitors but are challenging to develop because the lipid-linked substrate is not chemically altered in a flippase reaction. Here we show that MurJ inhibition can be quantified by measuring the accumulation of intracellular Lipid II using a biotin-tagging strategy. We have exploited this assay to show that MurJ is inhibited in the presence of a compound that dissipates the membrane potential. By probing cysteine accessibility we have found that under this condition MurJ relaxes into an inactive, outward-facing conformation reminiscent of that targeted by the peptide antibiotic LysM. We conclude that membrane potential is required for MurJ function in E. coli, and we anticipate that the ability to accumulate this inactive conformation will lead to structures useful for inhibitor design.},

This is despite the demonstration over three decades ago that the cellular DNA precursor pool is orders of magnitude more susceptible to modification than the DNA molecule itself. More recently, underscoring the importance of this topic, oxidation of the cellular nucleotide pool achieved through targeting the sanitation enzyme MTH1, appears to be a promising anti-cancer strategy.

Here, we discuss the series of large conformational changes set in motion by initial specific binding of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) to promoter DNA and their relevance for regulation. Bending and wrapping of the upstream duplex facilitates bending of the downstream duplex into the active site cleft, nucleating opening of 13 bp in the cleft. The rate-determining opening step, driven by binding free energy, forms an unstable open complex, probably with the template strand in the active site. At some promoters, this initial open complex is greatly stabilized by rearrangements of the discriminator region between the -10 element and +1 base of the nontemplate strand and of mobile in-cleft and downstream elements of RNAP. The rate of open complex formation is regulated by effects on the rapidly-reversible steps preceding DNA opening, while open complex lifetime is regulated by effects on the stabilization of the initial open complex. Intrinsic DNA opening-closing appears less regulated. This noncovalent mechanism and its regulation exhibit many analogies to mechanisms of enzyme catalysis.},

Unfortunately, to date, many of these systems have proven difficult to engineer without a detailed understanding of the kinetic relationships that regulate the concerted action of their constituent enzymes. This study develops a mechanistic kinetic model of the fatty acid synthase (FAS) of Escherichia coli and uses that model to determine how different FAS components work together to control the production of free fatty acids\textemdash precursors to a wide range of oleochemicals. Perturbational analyses indicate that the modification or overexpression of a single FAS component can depress fatty acid production (a commonly observed phenomenon) by sequestering the proteins with which it interacts and/or by depleting common substrate pools. Compositional studies, in turn, suggest that simple changes in the ratios of FAS components can alter the average length of fatty acids but show that specialized enzymes (i.e., highly specific ketoacyl synthases or thioesterases) are required for narrow product profiles. Intriguingly, a sensitivity analysis indicates that two components primarily influence\textemdash and, thus, enable fine control over\textemdash total production, but suggests that the enzymes that regulate product profile are more broadly influential. Findings thus reveal the general importance of kinetic considerations in efforts to engineer fatty acid biosynthesis and provide strategies\textemdash and a kinetic model\textemdash for incorporating those considerations into FAS designs.},

When the number of TFs heavily exceeds the number of binding sites, TF binding to each promoter can be regarded as independent. However, when the number of TF molecules is comparable to the number of binding sites, TF titration will result in correlation (``promoter entanglement'') between transcription of different genes. We develop a statistical mechanical model which takes the TF titration effect into account and use it to predict both the level of gene expression for a general set of promoters and the resulting correlation in transcription rates of different genes. Our results show that the TF titration effect could be important for understanding gene expression in many regulatory settings.},

In this article we make such a systematic investigation, based on a microscopic model of gene regulation that incorporates stochastic effects. In particular, we show how operator strength and operator multiplicity affect this variability. We examine different modes of transcription factor binding to complex promoters (cooperative, independent, simultaneous) and how each of these affects the level of variability in transcriptional output from cell-to-cell. We propose that direct comparison between in vivo single-cell experiments and theoretical predictions for the moments of the probability distribution of mRNA number per cell can be used to test kinetic models of gene regulation.

It is unclear why only a subset of TF bound sites are actively involved in transcriptional regulation. Moreover, the key genomic features that accurately discriminate between active and inactive TF binding events remain ambiguous. Recent studies have identified promoter-distal RNA polymerase II (RNAP2) binding at enhancer elements, suggesting that these interactions may serve as a marker for active regulatory sequences. Despite these correlative analyses, a thorough functional validation of these genomic co-occupancies is still lacking. To characterize the gene regulatory activity of DNA sequences underlying promoter-distal TF binding events that co-occur with RNAP2 and TF sites devoid of RNAP2 occupancy using a functional reporter assay, we performed cis-regulatory element sequencing (CRE-seq). We tested more than 1000 promoter-distal CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB)-bound sites in HepG2 and K562 cells, and found that CEBPB-bound sites co-occurring with RNAP2 were more likely to exhibit enhancer activity. CEBPB-bound sites further maintained substantial cell-type specificity, indicating that local DNA sequence can accurately convey cell-type\textendash specific regulatory information. By comparing our CRE-seq results to a comprehensive set of genome annotations, we identified a variety of genomic features that are strong predictors of regulatory element activity and cell-type\textendash specific activity. Collectively, our functional assay results indicate that RNAP2 occupancy can be used as a key genomic marker that can distinguish active from inactive TF bound sites.},

Faculty build on these results with their own research, and students and the public use these results for everything from patient care to public policy. To build a model for how academic libraries can support reproducible research, the authors conducted a review of major guidelines from funders, publishers, and professional societies. Specific recommendations were extracted from guidelines and compared with existing academic library services and librarian expertise. The authors believe this review shows that many of the recommendations for improving reproducibility are core areas of academic librarianship, including data management, scholarly communication, and methodological support for systematic reviews and data-intensive research.

We have investigated this issue in the bacterium Escherichia coli by analyzing the mutational properties of dcd and ndk strains. These strains, defective in dCTP deaminase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively, are characterized by both disturbances of dNTP pools and a mutator phenotype. ndk strains have been studied before, but were included in this study, as controversies exist regarding the source of its mutator phenotype. We show that dcd strains suffer from increased intracellular levels of dCTP (4-fold) and reduced levels of dGTP (2-fold), while displaying, as measured using a set of lacZ reversion markers in a mismatch-repair defective (mutL) background, a strong mutator effect for G{$\cdot$}C\textrightarrow T{$\cdot$}A and A{$\cdot$}T\textrightarrow T{$\cdot$}A transversions (27- and 42-fold enhancement, respectively). In contrast, ndk strains possess a lowered dATP level (4-fold) and modestly enhanced dCTP level (2-fold), while its mutator effect is specific for just the A{$\cdot$}T\textrightarrow T{$\cdot$}A transversions. The two strains also display differential mutability for rifampicin-resistant mutants. Overall, our analysis reveals for both strains a satisfactory correlation between dNTP pool alterations and the replication error rates, and also suggests that a minimal explanation for the ndk mutator does not require assumptions beyond the predicted effect of the dNTP pools.},

These quantities could be described as exponential functions of the growth rates afforded by the various media at a given temperature. The size and chemical composition characteristic of a given medium were not influenced by the temperature of cultivation. Thus, under conditions of balanced growth, this organism exists in one of a large number of possible stable physiological states. The variations in mass/cell are due to changes in the number of nuclei/cell as well as in mass/nucleus. An increase in the number of ribonucleoprotein particles at higher growth rates could, it appears, largely account for the increase in mass/nucleus. Calculations indicate that the rate of protein synthesis per unit RNA is nearly the same at all growth rates.},

Here, we establish the required quantitative approach for the death phase of the model bacterium Escherichia coli. We show that in carbon starvation, an exponential decay of viability emerges as a collective phenomenon, with viable cells recycling nutrients from cell carcasses to maintain viability. The observed collective death rate is determined by the maintenance rate of viable cells and the amount of nutrients recovered from dead cells. Using this relation, we study the cost of a wasteful enzyme during starvation and the benefit of the stress response sigma factor RpoS. While the enzyme increases maintenance and thereby the death rate, RpoS improves biomass recycling, decreasing the death rate. Our approach thus enables quantitative analyses of how cellular components affect the survival of non-growing cells.},

  abstract = {Stochastic fluctuations of molecule numbers are ubiquitous in biological systems. Important examples include gene expression and enzymatic processes in living cells. Such systems are typically modelled as chemical reaction networks whose dynamics are governed by the chemical master equation. Despite its simple structure, no analytic solutions to the chemical master equation are known for most systems. Moreover, stochastic simulations are computationally expensive, making systematic analysis and statistical inference a challenging task. Consequently, significant effort has been spent in recent decades on the development of efficient approximation and inference methods. This article gives an introduction to basic modelling concepts as well as an overview of state of the art methods. First, we motivate and introduce deterministic and stochastic methods for modelling chemical networks, and give an overview of simulation and exact solution methods. Next, we discuss several approximation methods, including the chemical Langevin equation, the system size expansion, moment closure approximations, time-scale separation approximations and hybrid methods. We discuss their various properties and review recent advances and remaining challenges for these methods. We present a comparison of several of these methods by means of a numerical case study and highlight some of their respective advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we discuss the problem of inference from experimental data in the Bayesian framework and review recent methods developed the literature. In summary, this review gives a self-contained introduction to modelling, approximations and inference methods for stochastic chemical kinetics.},

Mechanosensitive channels respond to membrane tension, are ubiquitous from bacteria to man, and exhibit a great diversity in structure and function. These channels protect Bacteria and Archaea against hypoosmotic shock and are critical determinants of shape in chloroplasts. Given the dominant roles played in bacteria by the mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) and the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL), the role of the multiple MS channel homologs observed in most organisms remains obscure. Here we demonstrate that a MscS homolog, YbdG, extends the range of hypoosmotic shock that \emph{Escherichia coli} cells can survive, but its expression level is insufficient to protect against severe shocks. Overexpression of the YbdG protein provides complete protection. Transcription and translation of the ybdG gene are enhanced by osmotic stress consistent with a role for the protein in survival of hypoosmotic shock. Measurement of the conductance of the native channel by standard patch clamp methods was not possible. However, a fully functional YbdG mutant channel, V229A, exhibits a conductance in membrane patches consistent with MscM activity. We find that MscM activities arise from more than one gene product because ybdG deletion mutants still exhibit an occasional MscM-like conductance. We propose that ybdG encodes a low-abundance MscM-type MS channel, which in cells relieves low levels of membrane tension, obviating the need to activate the major MS channels, MscS and MscL.},

Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

Western immunoblot analysis showed that in mutants lacking the protease ClpP or its cognate ATPase-containing subunit ClpX, sigma s levels of exponential-phase cells increased to those of stationary-phase wild-type cells. Lack of other potential partners of ClpP, i.e., ClpA or ClpB, or of Lon protease had no effect. In ClpXP-proficient cells, the stability of sigma s increased markedly in stationary-phase compared with exponential-phase cells, but in ClpP-deficient cells, sigma s became virtually completely stable in both phases. There was no decrease in ClpXP levels in stationary-phase wild-type cells. Thus, sigma s probably becomes more resistant to this protease in stationary phase. The reported sigma s-stabilizing effect of the hns mutation also was not due to decreased protease levels. Studies with translational fusions containing different lengths of sigma s coding region suggest that amino acid residues 173 to 188 of this sigma factor may directly or indirectly serve as at least part of the target for ClpXP protease.},

A theory incorporating these constraints can accurately predict how cell proliferation and gene expression affect one another, quantitatively accounting for the effect of translation-inhibiting antibiotics on gene expression and the effect of gratuitous protein expression on cell growth. The use of such empirical relations, analogous to phenomenological laws, may facilitate our understanding and manipulation of complex biological systems before underlying regulatory circuits are elucidated.

We identify supply-driven feedforward activation of ribosomal protein synthesis as the key regulatory motif maximizing amino acid flux, and autonomously guiding a cell to achieve optimal growth in different environments. The growth laws emerge naturally from the robust regulatory strategy underlying growth rate control, irrespective of the details of the molecular implementation. The study highlights the interplay between phenomenological modeling and molecular mechanisms in uncovering fundamental operating constraints, with implications for endogenous and synthetic design of microorganisms.},

We found an unexpectedly intricate function with four plateau levels and four thresholds. This result compares well with a mathematical model of the binding of the regulatory proteins cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and LacI to the lac regulatory region. The model is also used to demonstrate that with few mutations, the same region could encode much purer AND-like or even OR-like functions. This possibility means that the wild-type region is selected to perform an elaborate computation in setting the transcription rate.

  abstract = {Bacteria respond to osmotic stress by a substantial increase in the intracellular osmolality, adjusting their cell turgor for altered growth conditions. Using \emph{Escherichia coli} as a model organism we demonstrate here that bacterial responses to hyperosmotic stress specifically depend on the nature of osmoticum used. We show that increasing acute hyperosmotic NaCl stress above approximately 1.0 Os kg(-1) causes a dose-dependent K(+) leak from the cell, resulting in a substantial decrease in cytosolic K(+) content and a concurrent accumulation of Na(+) in the cell. At the same time, isotonic sucrose or mannitol treatment (non-ionic osmotica) results in a gradual increase of the net K(+) uptake. Ion flux data are consistent with growth experiments showing that bacterial growth is impaired by NaCl at the concentration resulting in a switch from net K(+) uptake to efflux. Microarray experiments reveal that about 40\% of upregulated genes shared no similarity in their responses to NaCl and sucrose treatment, further suggesting specificity of osmotic adjustment in \emph{E. coli} to ionic and non-ionic osmotica. The observed differences are explained by the specificity of the stress-induced changes in the membrane potential of bacterial cells highlighting the importance of voltage-gated K(+) transporters for bacterial adaptation to hyperosmotic stress.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli possesses regulatory mechanisms that coordinate cell growth with the synthesis of essential macromolecules (protein, RNA and DNA). While fundamental differences have been identified in the growth habit and chromosome structure of E. coli and Streptomyces, little is known about these regulatory mechanisms in filamentous bacteria. This paper reports on the relationship between the macromolecule content of S. coelicolor A3(2) and its specific growth rate. The protein, RNA and DNA contents (g per 100 g biomass) of S. coelicolor A3(2) grown in steady-state continuous culture over a range of specific growth rates (0.025-0.3 h-1) were 31-45, 10-22 and 3.5-4.5\% (w/w), respectively. This composition is qualitatively similar to that of other microorganisms. Changes in the macromolecular content of S. coelicolor A3(2) and E. coli B/r with specific growth rate appear to be essentially similar. However, the data indicate that the RNA content of S. coelicolor A3(2), grown under the conditions used, exceeds that of E. coli grown at the same specific growth rate. The data also suggest that overlapping rounds of replication are not a feature of DNA synthesis in S. coelicolor A3(2). This may be a function of the organism\&apos;s low maximum specific growth rate. Alternatively, it may be a consequence of regulatory mechanisms which act to inhibit the initiation of DNA synthesis in a linear chromosome which is already undergoing replication.,},

The V15C channel displayed disulfide crosslinking in air, but not in the presence of 100 mM {$\beta$}-mercaptoethanol. In single-channel experiments, the V15C channel was more sensitive to tension than was wild-type Tb-MscL. In air, Tb-MscL V15C occasionally displayed signature-events: at constant tension, there was first a sojourn in the highest conductance open state, then a series of transitions to substates. During a signature-event, these transitions do not appear to be reversible. Some sojourns in the lower conductance states lasted for {$\geq$}100 s. These signature-events were abolished by 100 mM {$\beta$}-mercaptoethanol and did not occur in a cysteineless gain-of-function mutant, suggesting that the signature-events represent disulfide crosslinking between channel subunits. We conclude that the crosslinking occurs during an open state during asymmetric sojourns that bring the {$\alpha$}-carbons of adjacent 15C side chains within 3.6\textendash 6.8 \AA. Such asymmetric structures must be considered in models of TB-MscL gating.},

  abstract = {Feeding a growing population while minimizing environmental degradation is a global challenge requiring thoroughly rethinking food production and consumption. Dietary choices control food availability and natural resource demands. In particular, reducing or avoiding consumption of low production efficiency animal-based products can spare resources that can then yield more food. In quantifying the potential food gains of specific dietary shifts, most earlier research focused on calories, with less attention to other important nutrients, notably protein. Moreover, despite the well-known environmental burdens of livestock, only a handful of national level feed-to-food conversion efficiency estimates of dairy, beef, poultry, pork, and eggs exist. Yet such high level estimates are essential for reducing diet related environmental impacts and identifying optimal food gain paths. Here we quantify caloric and protein conversion efficiencies for US livestock categories. We then use these efficiencies to calculate the food availability gains expected from replacing beef in the US diet with poultry, a more efficient meat, and a plant-based alternative. Averaged over all categories, caloric and protein efficiencies are 7\%\textendash 8\%. At 3\% in both metrics, beef is by far the least efficient. We find that reallocating the agricultural land used for beef feed to poultry feed production can meet the caloric and protein demands of {$\approx$}120 and {$\approx$}140 million additional people consuming the mean American diet, respectively, roughly 40\% of current US population.},

  abstract = {Food loss is widely recognized as undermining food security and environmental sustainability. However, consumption of resource-intensive food items instead of more efficient, equally nutritious alternatives can also be considered as an effective food loss. Here we define and quantify these opportunity food losses as the food loss associated with consuming resource-intensive animal-based items instead of plant-based alternatives which are nutritionally comparable, e.g., in terms of protein content. We consider replacements that minimize cropland use for each of the main US animal-based food categories. We find that although the characteristic conventional retail-to-consumer food losses are {$\approx$}30\% for plant and animal products, the opportunity food losses of beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs are 96\%, 90\%, 75\%, 50\%, and 40\%, respectively. This arises because plant-based replacement diets can produce 20-fold and twofold more nutritionally similar food per cropland than beef and eggs, the most and least resource-intensive animal categories, respectively. Although conventional and opportunity food losses are both targets for improvement, the high opportunity food losses highlight the large potential savings beyond conventionally defined food losses. Concurrently replacing all animal-based items in the US diet with plant-based alternatives will add enough food to feed, in full, 350 million additional people, well above the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food waste. These results highlight the importance of dietary shifts to improving food availability and security.},

This fundamental engineering constraint is an obstacle to synthetic biologists because it limits the computational capacity of engineered gene circuits. Here, we demonstrate that complex multi-input transcriptional logic gating can be achieved through the use of ligand-inducible chimeric transcription factors assembled from the LacI/GalR family. These modular chimeras each contain a ligand-binding domain and a DNA-binding domain, both of which are chosen from a library of possibilities. When two or more chimeras have the same DNA-binding domain, they independently and simultaneously regulate any promoter containing the appropriate operator site. In this manner, simple transcriptional AND gating is possible through the combination of two chimeras, and multiple-input AND gating is possible with the simultaneous use of three or even four chimeras. Furthermore, we demonstrate that orthogonal DNA-binding domains and their cognate operators allow the coexpression of multiple, orthogonal AND gates. Altogether, this work provides synthetic biologists with novel, ligand-inducible logic gates and greatly expands the possibilities for engineering complex synthetic gene circuits.},

Adaptation to a new physiological state leads to a change in cell size via reallocation of cellular resources. However, it has not been understood how cell size is coordinated with biosynthesis and robustly adapts to physiological states. We show that cell size in Escherichia coli can be predicted for any steady-state condition by projecting all biosynthesis into three measurable variables representing replication initiation, replication-division cycle, and the global biosynthesis rate. These variables can be decoupled by selectively controlling their respective core biosynthesis using CRISPR interference and antibiotics, verifying our predictions that different physiological states can result in the same cell size. We performed extensive growth inhibition experiments, and we discovered that cell size at replication initiation per origin, namely the initiation mass or unit cell, is remarkably invariant under perturbations targeting transcription, translation, ribosome content, replication kinetics, fatty acid and cell wall synthesis, cell division, and cell shape. Based on this invariance and balanced resource allocation, we explain why the total cell size is the sum of all unit cells. These results provide an overarching framework with quantitative predictive power over cell size in bacteria.},

  abstract = {Evolutionarily divergent bacteria share a common phenomenological strategy for cell-size homeostasis under steady-state conditions. In the presence of inherent physiological stochasticity, cells following this ``adder'' principle gradually return to their steady-state size by adding a constant volume between birth and division, regardless of their size at birth. However, the mechanism of the adder has been unknown despite intense efforts. In this work, we show that the adder is a direct consequence of two general processes in biology: (1) threshold\textemdash accumulation of initiators and precursors required for cell division to a respective fixed number\textemdash and (2) balanced biosynthesis\textemdash maintenance of their production proportional to volume growth. This mechanism is naturally robust to static growth inhibition but also allows us to ``reprogram'' cell-size homeostasis in a quantitatively predictive manner in both Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis. By generating dynamic oscillations in the concentration of the division protein FtsZ, we were able to oscillate cell size at division and systematically break the adder. In contrast, periodic induction of replication initiator protein DnaA caused oscillations in cell size at initiation but did not alter division size or the adder. Finally, we were able to restore the adder phenotype in slow-growing E. coli, the only known steady-state growth condition wherein E. coli significantly deviates from the adder, by repressing active degradation of division proteins. Together, these results show that cell division and replication initiation are independently controlled at the gene-expression level and that division processes exclusively drive cell-size homeostasis in bacteria.},

  abstract = {Interactions among bacteria and their viral predators, the bacteriophages, are likely among the most common ecological phenomena on Earth. The constant threat of phage infection to bacterial hosts, and the imperative of achieving infection on the part of phages, drives an evolutionary contest in which phage-resistant bacteria emerge, often followed by phages with new routes of infection. This process has received abundant theoretical and experimental attention for decades and forms an important basis for molecular genetics and theoretical ecology and evolution. However, at present, we know very little about the nature of phage-bacteria interaction \textendash{} and the evolution of phage resistance \textendash{} inside the surface-bound communities that microbes usually occupy in natural environments. These communities, termed biofilms, are encased in a matrix of secreted polymers produced by their microbial residents. Biofilms are spatially constrained such that interactions become limited to neighbors or nearneighbors; diffusion of solutes and particulates is reduced; and there is pronounced heterogeneity in nutrient access and therefore physiological state. These factors can dramatically impact the way phage infections proceed even in simple, single-strain biofilms, but we still know little of their effect on phage resistance evolutionary dynamics. Here we explore this problem using a computational simulation framework customized for implementing phage infection inside multi-strain biofilms. Our simulations predict that it is far easier for phage-susceptible and phageresistant bacteria to coexist inside biofilms relative to planktonic culture, where phages and hosts are well-mixed. We characterize the negative frequency dependent selection that underlies this coexistence, and we then test and confirm this prediction using an experimental model of biofilm growth measured with confocal microscopy at single-cell and single-phage resolution.},

  abstract = {Yeasts are often exposed to variations in osmotic pressure in their natural environments or in their substrates when used in fermentation industries. Such changes may lead to cell death or activity loss. Although the involvement of the plasma membrane is strongly suspected, the mechanism remains unclear. Here, the integrity and functionality of the yeast plasma membrane at different levels of dehydration and rehydration during an osmotic treatment were assessed using various fluorescent dyes. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of cells stained with oxonol, propidium iodide, and lucifer yellow were used to study changes in membrane polarization, permeabilization, and endocytosis, respectively. Cell volume contraction, reversible depolarization, permeabilization, and endovesicle formation were successively observed with increasing levels of osmotic pressure during dehydration. The maximum survival rate was also detected at a specific rehydration level, of 20 MPa, above which cells were strongly permeabilized. Thus, we show that the two steps of an osmotic treatment, dehydration and rehydration, are both involved in the induction of cell death. Permeabilization of the plasma membranes is the critical event related to cell death. It may result from lipidic phase transitions in the membrane and from variations in the area-to-volume ratio during the osmotic treatment.},

Other topics covered include reliability analysis, multivariate optimization, least-squares and maximum likelihood, error-propagation, hypothesis testing, maximum entropy and experimental design.The Second Edition of this successful tutorial book contains a new chapter on extensions to the ubiquitous least-squares procedure, allowing for the straightforward handling of outliers and unknown correlated noise, and a cutting-edge contribution from John Skilling on a novel numerical technique for Bayesian computation called 'nested sampling'.},

            Life cycle assessment has become an increasingly common approach for identifying, quantifying, and evaluating the total potential environmental impact of production processes or products, from the procurement of raw materials (the `cradle'), to production and utilization (the `gates') and their final storage (the `grave'), as well as for determining ways to repair damage to the environment. The paper describes life cycle assessment of mineral fertilizers. On the basis of results provided by life cycle assessment, it can be concluded that an effective strategy for protecting the environment against the harmful effects of fertilizers is to attempt to `seal' the nutrient cycle on a global, regional, and local scale. Pro-environ- mental measures aim on the one hand to reduce resource utilization, and on the other hand to limit losses of nutrients, during both production and use of fertilizers. An undoubted challenge for life cycle assessment when used in agricultural production is the need for relevance at each scale.},

This mechanism can also generate bistable promoter responses, allowing a gene to be on in some cells and off in others, despite the cells being in identical conditions. In addition, the system provides a simple means by which the activities of many TFs could be integrated at a promoter.},

An accurate measurement of repressor, DNA and effector concentrations were made both in vivo and in vitro allowing for direct modeling of the entire thermodynamic equilibrium. In vivo repression profiles are accurately predicted from the given in vitro parameters when molecular crowding is considered. Interestingly, our measured repressor\textendash operator DNA affinity differs significantly from previous in vitro measurements. The literature values are unable to replicate in vivo binding data. We therefore conclude that the repressor-DNA affinity is much weaker than previously thought.

  abstract = {Background: In fast-growing bacteria, the genomic location of ribosomal protein (RP) genes is biased towards the replication origin (oriC). This trait allows optimizing their expression during exponential phase since oriC neighboring regions are in higher dose due to multifork replication. Relocation of s10-spc-{$\alpha$} locus (S10), which codes for most of the RP, to ectopic genomic positions shows that its relative distance to the oriC correlates to a reduction on its dosage, its expression, and bacterial growth rate. However, a mechanism linking S10 dosage to cell physiology has still not been determined.
Results: We hypothesized that S10 dosage perturbations impact protein synthesis capacity. Strikingly, we observed that in Vibrio cholerae, protein production capacity was independent of S10 position. Deep sequencing revealed that S10 relocation altered chromosomal replication dynamics and genome-wide transcription. Such changes increased as a function of oriC-S10 distance. Since RP constitutes a large proportion of cell mass, lower S10 dosage could lead to changes in macromolecular crowding, impacting cell physiology. Accordingly, cytoplasm fluidity was higher in mutants where S10 is most distant from oriC. In hyperosmotic conditions, when crowding differences are minimized, the growth rate and replication dynamics were highly alleviated in these strains.
Conclusions: The genomic location of RP genes ensures its optimal dosage. However, besides of its essential function in translation, their genomic position sustains an optimal macromolecular crowding essential for maximizing growth. Hence, this could be another mechanism coordinating DNA replication to bacterial growth.},

However, it has a number of growth defects. Internal pyrimidine starvation due to polarity of the rph-1 allele on pyrE was problematic in continuous culture. Moreover, the isolate of MG1655 obtained from the \emph{E. coli} Genetic Stock Center also carries a large deletion around the fnr (fumarate-nitrate respiration) regulatory gene. Although studies on DNA microarrays revealed apparent cross-regulation of gene expression between galactose and lactose metabolism in the Stock Center isolate of MG1655, this was due to the occurrence of mutations that increased lacY expression and suppressed slow growth on galactose. The explanation for apparent cross-regulation between galactose and N-acetylglucosamine metabolism was similar. By contrast, cross-regulation between lactose and maltose metabolism appeared to be due to generation of internal maltosaccharides in lactose-grown cells and may be physiologically significant. Lactose is of restricted distribution: it is normally found together with maltosaccharides, which are starch degradation products, in the mammalian intestine. Strains designated MG1655 and obtained from other sources differed from the Stock Center isolate and each other in several respects. We confirmed that use of other \emph{E. coli} strains with MG1655-based DNA microarrays works well, and hence these arrays can be used to study any strain of interest. The responses to nitrogen limitation of two urinary tract isolates and an intestinal commensal strain isolated recently from humans were remarkably similar to those of MG1655.},

The planetary boundary (PB) concept, introduced in 2009, aimed to define the environmental limits within which humanity can safely operate. This approach has proved influential in global sustainability policy development. Steffen et al. provide an updated and extended analysis of the PB framework. Of the original nine proposed boundaries, they identify three (including climate change) that might push the Earth system into a new state if crossed and that also have a pervasive influence on the remaining boundaries. They also develop the PB framework so that it can be applied usefully in a regional context.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTION There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.
RATIONALE The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES\textemdash its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low\textemdash a ``safe operating space'' for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).
RESULTS Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier ``biodiversity loss''), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs\textemdash climate change and biosphere integrity\textemdash are recognized as ``core'' PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth's surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).
CONCLUSIONS PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6223/1259855/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Current status of the control variables for seven of the planetary boundaries. The green zone is the safe operating space, the yellow represents the zone of uncertainty (increasing risk), and the red is a high-risk zone. The planetary boundary itself lies at the intersection of the green and yellow zones. The control variables have been normalized for the zone of uncertainty; the center of the figure therefore does not represent values of 0 for the control variables. The control variable shown for climate change is atmospheric CO2 concentration. Processes for which global-level boundaries cannot yet be quantified are represented by gray wedges; these are atmospheric aerosol loading, novel entities, and the functional role of biosphere integrity.
The planetary boundaries framework defines a safe operating space for humanity based on the intrinsic biophysical processes that regulate the stability of the Earth system. Here, we revise and update the planetary boundary framework, with a focus on the underpinning biophysical science, based on targeted input from expert research communities and on more general scientific advances over the past 5 years. Several of the boundaries now have a two-tier approach, reflecting the importance of cross-scale interactions and the regional-level heterogeneity of the processes that underpin the boundaries. Two core boundaries\textemdash climate change and biosphere integrity\textemdash have been identified, each of which has the potential on its own to drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and persistently transgressed.
Developments in the planetary boundaries concept provide a framework to support global sustainability.

  abstract = {Earth System Science (ESS) is a rapidly emerging transdisciplinary endeavour aimed at understanding the structure and functioning of the Earth as a complex, adaptive system. Here, we discuss the emergence and evolution of ESS, outlining the importance of these developments in advancing our understanding of global change. Inspired by early work on biosphere\textendash geosphere interactions and by novel perspectives such as the Gaia hypothesis, ESS emerged in the 1980s following demands for a new `science of the Earth'. The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme soon followed, leading to an unprecedented level of international commitment and disciplinary integration. ESS has produced new concepts and frameworks central to the global-change discourse, including the Anthropocene, tipping elements and planetary boundaries. Moving forward, the grand challenge for ESS is to achieve a deep integration of biophysical processes and human dynamics to build a truly unified understanding of the Earth System.},

  abstract = {The role of the rRNA gene copy number as a central component of bacterial life histories was studied by using strains of Escherichia coli in which one or two of the seven rRNA operons (rrnA and/or rrnB) were deleted. The relative fitness of these strains was determined in competition experiments in both batch and chemostat cultures. In batch cultures, the decrease in relative fitness corresponded to the number of rRNA operons deleted, which could be accounted for completely by increased lag times and decreased growth rates. The magnitude of the deleterious effect varied with the environment in which fitness was measured: the negative consequences of rRNA operon deletions increased under culture conditions permitting more-rapid growth. The rRNA operon deletion strains were not more effective competitors under the regimen of constant, limited resources provided in chemostat cultures. Enhanced fitness in chemostat cultures would have suggested a simple tradeoff in which deletion strains grew faster (due to more efficient resource utilization) under resource limitation. The contributions of growth rate, lag time, Ks, and death rate to the fitness of each strain were verified through mathematical simulation of competition experiments. These data support the hypothesis that multiple rRNA operons are a component of bacterial life history and that they confer a selective advantage permitting microbes to respond quickly and grow rapidly in environments characterized by fluctuations in resource availability.},

Here, we analyze the fitness effects of all single mutations in TEM-1 b-lactamase (4,997 variants) under selection for the wild-type function (ampicillin resistance) and for a new function (cefotaxime resistance). Tolerance to mutation in this enzyme is bimodal and dependent on the strength of purifying selection in vivo, a result that derives from a steep non-linear ampicillin-dependent relationship between biochemical activity and fitness. Interestingly, cefotaxime resistance emerges from mutations that are neutral at low levels of ampicillin but deleterious at high levels; thus the capacity to evolve new function also depends on the strength of selection. The key property controlling evolvability is an excess of enzymatic activity relative to the strength of selection, suggesting that fluctuating environments might select for high-activity enzymes.},

We demonstrate that MscS and MscL are induced by osmotic stress and by entry into stationary phase. Reduced levels of MS proteins and reduced expression of mscL- and mscS-LacZ fusions in an rpoS mutant strain suggested that the RNA polymerase holoenzyme containing sigmaS is responsible, at least in part, for regulating production of MS channel proteins. Consistent with the model that the effect of sigmaS is direct, the MscS and MscL promoters both use RNA polymerase containing sigmaS in vitro. Conversely, clpP or rssB mutations, which cause enhanced levels of sigmaS, show increased MS channel protein synthesis. RpoS null mutants are sensitive to hypoosmotic shock upon entry into stationary phase. These data suggest that MscS and MscL are components of the RpoS regulon and play an important role in ensuring structural integrity in stationary phase bacteria.},

  abstract = {The amount of ATP required for the formation of microbial cells growing under various conditions was calculated. It was assumed that the chemical composition of the cell was the same under all these conditions. The analysis of the chemical composition of microbial cells of Morowitz (1968) was taken as a base. It was assumed that 4 moles of ATP are required for the incorporation of one mole of amino acid into protein. The amount of ATP required on account of the instability and frequent regeneration of messenger RNA was calculated from data in the literature pertaining to the relative rates of synthesis of the various classes of RNA molecules in the cell. An estimate is given of the amount of ATP required for transport processes. For this purpose it was assumed that 0.5 mole of ATP is necessary for the uptake of 1 g-ion of potassium or ammonium, and 1 mole of ATP for the uptake of 1 mole of phosphate, amino acid, acetate, malate etc. The results of the calculations show that from preformed monomers (glucose, amino acids and nucleic acid bases) 31.9 g cells can be formed per g-mole of ATP when acetyl-CoA is formed from glucose. When acetyl-CoA cannot be formed from glucose and must be formed from acetate, YATPMAXis only 26.4. For growth with glucose and inorganic salts a YATPMAXvalue of 28.8 was found. Addition of amino acids was without effect on YATPMAXbut addition of nucleic acid bases increased the YATPMAXvalue to that for cells growing with preformed monomers. Under these conditions 15\textendash 20\% of the total ATP required for cell formation is used for transport processes. Much lower YATPMAXvalues are found for growth with malate, lactate or acetate and inorganic salts. During growth on these substrates a greater part of the ATP required for cell formation is used for transport processes. The calculated figures are very close to the experimental values found.},

SuperSegger incorporates machine-learning algorithms to optimize cellular boundaries and automated error resolution to reliably link cells from frame-to-frame. Unlike existing packages, it can reliably segment microcolonies with many cells, facilitating the analysis of cell-cycle dynamics in bacteria as well as cell-contact mediated phenomena. This package has a range of built-in capabilities for characterizing bacterial cells, including the identification of cell division events, mother, daughter and neighbouring cells, and computing statistics on cellular fluorescence, the location and intensity of fluorescent foci. SuperSegger provides a variety of postprocessing data visualization tools for single cell and population level analysis, such as histograms, kymographs, frame mosaics, movies and consensus images. Finally, we demonstrate the power of the package by analyzing lag phase growth with single cell resolution.},

Application of this method for three structurally and functionally distinct protein families (G protein\textendash coupled receptors, the chymotrypsin class of serine proteases and hemoglobins) reveals a surprisingly simple architecture for amino acid interactions in each protein family: a small subset of residues forms physically connected networks that link distant functional sites in the tertiary structure. Although small in number, residues comprising the network show excellent correlation with the large body of mechanistic data available for each family. The data suggest that evolutionarily conserved sparse networks of amino acid interactions represent structural motifs for allosteric communication in proteins.},

  abstract = {Mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) which could provide for fast osmoregulatory responses in bacteria, remain unidentified as molecular entities. MSCs from \emph{Escherichia coli} (strain AW740) were examined using the patch-clamp technique, either (a) in giant spheroplasts, (b) after reconstitution by fusing native membrane vesicles with asolectin liposomes, or (c) by reassembly of octylglucoside-solubilized membrane extract into asolectin liposomes. MSC activities were similar in all three preparations, consisting of a large nonselective MSC of 3-nS conductance (in 200 mM KCl) that was activated by high negative pressures, and a small weakly anion-selective MSC of 1 nS activated by lower negative pressures. Both channels appeared more sensitive to suction in liposomes than in spheroplasts. After gel filtration of the solubilized membrane extract and reconstituting the fractions, both large MSC and small MSC activities were retrieved in liposomes. The positions of the peaks of channel activity in the column eluate, assayed by patch sampling of individual fractions reconstituted in liposomes, showed an apparent molecular mass under nondenaturing conditions of about 60-80 kDa for the large and 200-400 kDa for the small MSC. We conclude that (a) the large MSC and the small MSC are distinct molecular entities, (b) the fact that both MSCs were functional in liposomes following chromatography strongly suggests that these channels are gated by tension transduced via lipid bilayer, and (c) chromatographic fractionation of detergent-solubilized membrane proteins with subsequent patch sampling of reconstituted fractions can be used to identify and isolate these MS channel proteins.},

  abstract = {MscL is multimeric protein that forms a large conductance mechanosensitive channel in the inner membrane of \emph{Escherichia coli}. Since MscL is gated by tension transmitted through the lipid bilayer, we have been able to measure its gating parameters as a function of absolute tension. Using purified MscL reconstituted in liposomes, we recorded single channel currents and varied the pressure gradient (P) to vary the tension (T). The tension was calculated from P and the radius of curvature was obtained using video microscopy of the patch. The probability of being open (Po) has a steep sigmoidal dependence on T, with a midpoint (T1/2) of 11.8 dyn/cm. The maximal slope sensitivity of Po/Pc was 0.63 dyn/cm per e-fold. Assuming a Boltzmann distribution, the energy difference between the closed and fully open states in the unstressed membrane was DeltaE = 18.6 kBT. If the mechanosensitivity arises from tension acting on a change of in-plane area (DeltaA), the free energy, TDeltaA, would correspond to DeltaA = 6.5 nm2. MscL is not a binary channel, but has four conducting states and a closed state. Most transition rates are independent of tension, but the rate-limiting step to opening is the transition between the closed state and the lowest conductance substate. This transition thus involves the greatest DeltaA. When summed over all transitions, the in-plane area change from closed to fully open was 6 nm2, agreeing with the value obtained in the two-state analysis. Assuming a cylindrical channel, the dimensions of the (fully open) pore were comparable to DeltaA. Thus, the tension dependence of channel gating is primarily one of increasing the external channel area to accommodate the pore of the smallest conducting state. The higher conducting states appear to involve conformational changes internal to the channel that don't involve changes in area.},

  abstract = {In the absence of sugars, C4-dicarboxylates (C4DC) like fumarate represent important substrates for growth of Escherichia coli. Aerobically, C4DCs are oxidized to CO2 whereas anaerobically, C4DCs are used for fumarate respiration. In order to determine the impact of fumarate under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, proteomes of E. coli W3110 grown aerobically or anaerobically with fumarate and/or the non-C4DC substrate glycerol were comparatively profiled by nanoLC-MS/MS. Membrane enrichment allowed sensitive detection of membrane proteins. A total of 1657 proteins of which 646 and 374 were assigned to the cytosol or membrane, respectively, were covered. Presence of fumarate triggered changes ({$\geq$} 2fold) to the levels of 211 and 76 proteins under aerobic and anaerobic growth, respectively. The fumarate induced changes included proteins encoded by genes regulated by the C4DC two-component system DcuS-DcuR (DctA, DcuB, FumB, FrdABC proteins) catalyzing uptake and initial catabolic steps. Many of the proteins displaying altered levels are not part of the DcuS-DcuR regulon, including proteins of citric acid cycle and associated pathways (aerobic), proteins involved in motility and chemotaxis (anaerobic), and oxidative stress. Their genes are mostly preceded by cAMP receptor protein (CRP) sites, some by DcuR-like sites. Testing of selected genes confirmed regulation by CRP and DcuS-DcuR.
Significance
Global protein profiling of the soluble and the membrane fraction provides a comprehensive view on the protein pattern of E. coli grown aerobically and anaerobically with or without fumarate. The results disclose during aerobic growth besides the known impact of the C4-dicarboxylates (C4DC) on carbon utilization and citric acid cycle major adaptations in amino acid metabolism. In contrast, protein alterations in the presence of fumarate under anaerobic conditions point to enhanced motility and chemotaxis. Only proteins (transporters, initial metabolic steps) feeding external C4DCs to the central pathways were regulated by the C4DC two-component system DcuS-DcuR, whereas other protein levels were controlled in an indirect manner by CRP triggered catabolite control and other mechanisms. Consequently, metabolic and transcriptional regulation by C4DCs is apparently effected by a network of the DcuS-DcuR system with important contribution by catabolite control.},

  abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for \emph{Escherichia coli}.},

  abstract = {Often the time derivative of a measured variable is of as much interest as the variable itself. For a growing population of biological cells, for example, the population's growth rate is typically more important than its size. Here we introduce a non-parametric method to infer first and second time derivatives as a function of time from time-series data. Our approach is based on Gaussian processes and applies to a wide range of data. In tests, the method is at least as accurate as others, but has several advantages: it estimates errors both in the inference and in any summary statistics, such as lag times, and allows interpolation with the corresponding error estimation. As illustrations, we infer growth rates of microbial cells, the rate of assembly of an amyloid fibril and both the speed and acceleration of two separating spindle pole bodies. Our algorithm should thus be broadly applicable.},

LuxN, a nine-transmembrane domain protein from Vibrio harveyi, is the founding example of membrane-bound receptors for acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducers. We used mutagenesis and suppressor analyses to identify the AHL-binding domain of LuxN and discovered LuxN mutants that confer both decreased and increased AHL sensitivity. Our analysis of doseresponse curves of multiple LuxN mutants pins these inverse phenotypes on quantifiable opposing shifts in the free-energy bias of LuxN for occupying its kinase and phosphatase states. To understand receptor activation and to characterize the pathway signaling parameters, we exploited a strong LuxN antagonist, one of fifteen small-molecule antagonists we identified. We find that quorum-sensing-mediated communication can be manipulated positively and negatively to control bacterial behavior and, more broadly, that signaling parameters can be deduced from in vivo data.},

  abstract = {Protein structural change underlies many signal transduction processes. Although end-state structures are known for various allosteric proteins, intermediates are difficult to observe. Recently, targeted molecular dynamics simulation (TMD) was used to examine the conformational transition and predict relevant intermediates for wild-type lactose repressor (LacI). A catalog of involved residues suggests that the transition of this homodimer is asymmetric and that K84 is a prominent participant in the dynamic N-subdomain interface. Previous experiments indicated that hydrophobic substitutions at position 84 engender slowed, biphasic inducer binding kinetics, which might reflect the same phenomena observed in TMD. Here, we report biochemical confirmation that DNA and inducer binding remain allosterically linked in K84A and K84L, albeit with a differential smaller than that found in wild-type LacI. Other features of these mutant proteins are consistent with an allosteric conformational shift that approximates that of the wild type. As a consequence, these repressors can be utilized to explore an unanswered question about LacI function: How many inducers (one or two per dimer) are required to diminish operator affinity? The biphasic natures of the K84L and K84A inducer association rates allow direct correlation between the two distinct inducer binding events and operator release. Indeed, the kinetics of operator release for the K84A and K84L closely parallel those for the second inducer binding event. Together with implications from previous equilibrium results for wild-type and mutant proteins, these kinetic data demonstrate that binding of two inducers per dimeric DNA binding unit is required to release the operator in these variant LacI proteins.},

At least four promoters responsible for rpoS transcription were identified, and designated P1, P2, P3 and P4, P1 being furthest from the upstream. Using lacZ fusion genes, the P2 promoter was found to be the strongest of the four. All of these promoters are regulated similarly, and their activity is enhanced 2 to 3-fold in stationary phase. P1 and P2 transcription start sites were determined by primer extension analyses. The P2 promoter region shows similarity to the consensus sigma 70-type promoter sequence, and was recognized by both E sigma 70 and E sigma 38 holoenzymes in vitro. The mRNA transcribed from the most distal promoter, P1, appears to include another open reading frame (orf-281), indicating that the two open reading frames comprise an operon. The rpoS gene product (sigma 38) was rapidly degraded after addition of chloramphenicol to cultures in the exponential, but not the stationary phase. This strongly suggests that posttranslational regulation is involved in the control of rpoS expression.},

  abstract = {Artificial selection of broiler chickens for commercial objectives has been employed at an unprecedented magnitude over the recent decades. Consequently, the number of days, total feed and in turn energy, required to raise a broiler to slaughter weight, have decreased dramatically. Feed provision is the poultry industry's biggest environmental hotspot; hence, understanding the interactions between the birds' genetic change and their energy use efficiency forms the necessary starting point for quantifying and predicting and thereby mitigating the future environmental impact of the poultry sector. This review assesses the consequences of artificial selection on the following traits: digestive efficiency, body composition and utilisation of metabolisable energy for growth and metabolic activity. The main findings were (1) the digestive system has been subjected to much physical change due to selection in the recent decades, but this has not led to any apparent change in digestion efficiency. (2) Both the energy intake per day and the metabolic heat production rate have increased in the recent decades whilst (3) the efficiency of utilising energy for growth has also increased; this is due to an increased growth rate, so that broilers reach slaughter weight more quickly and therefore need to allocate less energy overall to metabolic processes, with the exception of growth. (4) There may have been a reduction in the tendency to waste feed through spillage and carry out energetically expensive behaviors. There is a discrepancy in the literature with regards to the influence of selection on body composition and its contribution to feed efficiency. In this review, two scenarios are demonstrated, whereby body composition either has or has not altered via artificial selection. Understanding the effects of artificial selection on the traits that relate to the feed efficiency of the broilers will contribute towards the reduction of the environmental impacts that arise from such systems.},

This procedure not only identifies inaccurate computation and inconsistencies in model implementations but also provides graphical summaries that can indicate the nature of the problems that arise.

Genome changes are introduced first through the integration of a 1.3 kbp Landing Pad consisting of a gene conferring resistance to tetracycline (tetA) or the ability to metabolize the sugar galactose (galK). The Landing Pad is then excised as a result of double-strand breaks by the homing endonuclease I-SceI, and replaced with DNA fragments bearing the desired change via {$\lambda$}-Red mediated homologous recombination. Repair of the double strand breaks and counterselection against the Landing Pad (using NiCl2 for tetA or 2-deoxy-galactose for galK) allows the isolation of modified bacteria without the use of additional antibiotic selection. We demonstrate the power of this method to make a variety of genome modifications: the exact integration, without any extraneous sequence, of the lac operon (\textasciitilde 6.5 kbp) to any desired location in the genome and without the integration of antibiotic markers; the scarless deletion of ribosomal rrn operons (\textasciitilde 6 kbp) through either intrachromosomal or oligonucleotide recombination; and the in situ fusion of native genes to fluorescent reporter genes without additional perturbation.},

  abstract = {Metabolic network models describing growth of Escherichia coli on glucose, glycerol and acetate were derived from a genome scale model of E. coli. One of the uncertainties in the metabolic networks is the exact stoichiometry of energy generating and consuming processes. Accurate estimation of biomass and product yields requires correct information on the ATP stoichiometry. The unknown ATP stoichiometry parameters of the constructed E. coli network were estimated from experimental data of eight different aerobic chemostat experiments carried out with E. coli MG1655, grown at different dilution rates (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.3 h-1) and on different carbon substrates (glucose, glycerol, and acetate). Proper estimation of the ATP stoichiometry requires proper information on the biomass composition of the organism as well as accurate assessment of net conversion rates under well-defined conditions. For this purpose a growth rate dependent biomass composition was derived, based on measurements and literature data. After incorporation of the growth rate dependent biomass composition in a metabolic network model, an effective P/O ratio of 1.49 {$\pm$} 0.26 mol of ATP/mol of O, KX (growth dependent maintenance) of 0.46 {$\pm$} 0.27 mol of ATP/C-mol of biomass and mATP (growth independent maintenance) of 0.075 {$\pm$} 0.015 mol of ATP/C-mol of biomass/h were estimated using a newly developed Comprehensive Data Reconciliation (CDR) method, assuming that the three energetic parameters were independent of the growth rate and the used substrate. The resulting metabolic network model only requires the specific rate of growth, \textmu, as an input in order to accurately predict all other fluxes and yields. Biotechnol.

Biofilms are associated with biotic and abiotic surfaces and are composed of aggregates of cells that are encased by a self-produced or acquired extracellular matrix. Vibrio cholerae has been studied as a model organism for understanding biofilm formation in environmental pathogens, as it spends much of its life cycle outside of the human host in the aquatic environment. Given the important role of biofilm formation in the V. cholerae life cycle, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process and the signals that trigger biofilm assembly or dispersal have been areas of intense investigation over the past 20 years. In this Review, we discuss V. cholerae surface attachment, various matrix components and the regulatory networks controlling biofilm formation.},

  abstract = {Biofilm formation and host-pathogen interactions are frequently studied using multiwell plates; however, these closed systems lack shear force, which is present at several sites in the host, such as the intestinal and urinary tracts. Recently, microfluidic systems that incorporate shear force and very small volumes have been developed to provide cell biology models that resemble in vivo conditions. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if the BioFlux 200 microfluidic system could be used to study host-pathogen interactions and biofilm formation by pathogenic Escherichia coli. Strains of various pathotypes were selected to establish the growth conditions for the formation of biofilms in the BioFlux 200 system on abiotic (glass) or biotic (eukaryotic-cell) surfaces. Biofilm formation on glass was observed for the majority of strains when they were grown in M9 medium at 30\textdegree C but not in RPMI medium at 37\textdegree C. In contrast, HRT-18 cell monolayers enhanced binding and, in most cases, biofilm formation by pathogenic E. coli in RPMI medium at 37\textdegree C. As a proof of principle, the biofilm-forming ability of a diffusely adherent E. coli mutant strain lacking AIDA-I, a known mediator of attachment, was assessed in our models. In contrast to the parental strain, which formed a strong biofilm, the mutant formed a thin biofilm on glass or isolated clusters on HRT-18 monolayers. In conclusion, we describe a microfluidic method for high-throughput screening that could be used to identify novel factors involved in E. coli biofilm formation and host-pathogen interactions under shear force.},

  abstract = {Active-site serine D,D-transpeptidases belonging to the penicillin-binding protein family (PBPs) have been considered for a long time as essential for peptidoglycan cross-linking in all bacteria. However, bypass of the PBPs by an L,D-transpeptidase (Ldtfm) conveys high-level resistance to {$\beta$}-lactams of the penam class in Enterococcus faecium with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ampicillin {$>$}2,000 \textmu g/ml. Unexpectedly, Ldtfm does not confer resistance to {$\beta$}-lactams of the carbapenem class (imipenem MIC = 0.5 \textmu g/ml) whereas cephems display residual activity (ceftriaxone MIC = 128 \textmu g/ml). Mass spectrometry, fluorescence kinetics, and NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments were performed to explore the basis for this specificity and identify {$\beta$}-lactam features that are critical for efficient L,D-transpeptidase inactivation. We show that imipenem, ceftriaxone, and ampicillin acylate Ldtfm by formation of a thioester bond between the active-site cysteine and the {$\beta$}-lactam-ring carbonyl. However, slow acylation and slow acylenzyme hydrolysis resulted in partial Ldtfm inactivation by ampicillin and ceftriaxone. For ampicillin, Ldtfm acylation was followed by rupture of the C5\textendash C6 bond of the {$\beta$}-lactam ring and formation of a secondary acylenzyme prone to hydrolysis. The saturable step of the catalytic cycle was the reversible formation of a tetrahedral intermediate (oxyanion) without significant accumulation of a non-covalent complex. In agreement, a derivative of Ldtfm blocked in acylation bound ertapenem (a carbapenem), ceftriaxone, and ampicillin with similar low affinities. Thus, oxyanion and acylenzyme stabilization are both critical for rapid L,D-transpeptidase inactivation and antibacterial activity. These results pave the way for optimization of the {$\beta$}-lactam scaffold for L,D-transpeptidase-inactivation.},

The results indicate that cells are shorter and somewhat thicker at the lower temperatures, especially in rich growth media; cell volume is then slightly smaller. A lower temperature was further found to increase the relative duration of the constriction period. The shapes of the cell size distributions are indistinguishable, indicating that the pattern of growth of the cells is the same at all temperatures. The adaptation of the cells to a temperature shift lasted several generations, indicating that the morphological effects of temperature are mediated by the cell's physiology.},

Changes correlated with altered repression, but estimates of in vivo repressor concentration suggest a {$\geq$}25-fold discrepancy with in vitro conditions. In the second system, changes in ligand binding to BirA altered dimerization and subsequent DNA occupancy. Again, these changes correlate with altered in vivo repression, but comparison with in vitro measurements reveals a \textasciitilde 10-fold discrepancy. Further analysis of each system suggests that the observed discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results reflect the contributions of additional equilibria to the transcription repression process.},

We provide an experimental approach and theoretical framework for measuring the mechanical properties of live bacteria.

Our data provide estimates of cell wall stiffness similar to values obtained via the more labour-intensive technique of atomic force microscopy. To address physiological perturbations that produce changes in cellular mechanical properties, we tested the effect of A22-induced MreB depolymerization on the stiffness of \emph{E. coli}. The effective longitudinal Young's modulus was not significantly affected by A22 treatment at short time scales, supporting a model in which the interactions between MreB and the cell wall persist on the same time scale as growth. Our technique therefore enables the rapid determination of how changes in genotype and biochemistry affect the mechanical properties of the bacterial envelope.},

The energetics of deformation allow two membrane proteins in close proximity to influence each other's equilibrium conformation via their local deformations, and spatially organize the proteins based on their geometry. We use the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) as a case study to examine the implications of bilayer-mediated elastic interactions on protein conformational statistics and clustering. The deformations around MscL cost energy on the order of 10 kBT and extend approximately 3 nm from the protein edge, as such elastic forces induce cooperative gating, and we propose experiments to measure these effects. Additionally, since elastic interactions are coupled to protein conformation, we find that conformational changes can severely alter the average separation between two proteins. This has important implications for how conformational changes organize membrane proteins into functional groups within membranes.},

Questions remain as to how the cell maintains small fluid lipid domains, through time, on a length scale consistent with the fact that no large-scale phase separation is observed. Motivated by these examples, we have utilized a combination of mechanical modeling and in vitro experiments to show that membrane morphology plays a key role in maintaining small domain sizes and organizing domains in a model membrane. We demonstrate that lipid domains can adopt a flat or dimpled morphology, where the latter facilitates a repulsive interaction that slows coalescence and helps regulate domain size and tends to laterally organize domains in the membrane.},

Furthermore, there is need for specific growth rate ({$\mu$}) dependent absolute quantitative transcriptome and proteome data to understand the molecular relationships for enabling cells to modify {$\mu$}. We address these questions, for the first time, by presenting regulatory strategies for more efficient metabolism of Escherichia coli at higher {$\mu$} by statistical covariance analysis of genome-wide intracellular mRNA and protein concentrations coupled to metabolic flux analysis in the steady state range of {$\mu$} = 0.11\textendash 0.49 h-1. Our analyses show dominating post-transcriptional control of protein abundances and post-translational control of flux rates. On average, E. coli achieved five-times faster growth through 3.7-fold increase of apparent catalytic rates of enzymes (kapp) and 2.5-fold increased translation rates, demonstrating the relevance of post-translational regulation for increasing flux throughput. Interestingly, pathways carrying the highest flux showed both high protein abundance and kapp values. Furthermore, co-regulation analysis of enzymatic capacities revealed tightly coupled regulatory dependencies of protein synthesis and RNA precursor synthesis, substrate utilization, biosynthetic and energy generation pathways carrying the highest flux. We also observed metabolic pathway and COG specific protein and metabolic flux control levels, protein expression costs and genome-wide principles for translation efficiency and transcription unit polarity. This work contributes to the much needed quantitative understanding of coordinated gene expression regulation and metabolic flux control. Our findings will also advance modeling and metabolic engineering of industrial strains.},

  abstract = {Background: Experimental evolution of microbes often involves a serial transfer protocol, where microbes are repeatedly diluted by transfer to a fresh medium, starting a new growth cycle. This protocol has revealed that evolution can be remarkably reproducible, where microbes show parallel adaptations both on the level of the phenotype as well as the genotype. However, these studies also reveal a strong potential for divergent evolution, leading to diversity both between and within replicate populations. We here study how in silico evolved Virtual Microbe ``wild types'' (WTs) adapt to a serial transfer protocol to investigate both the generic evolutionary adaptation to such an environment which are independent of prior evolution, and the variety of ways in which the adaptation is implemented at the individual and ecosystem level.
Results: We show that all pre-evolved WTs evolve to anticipate the regularity of the serial transfer protocol by adopting a fine-tuned balance of growth and survival. We find that this anticipation can be done in a variety of ways, either by a single lineage or by several lineages in consort. Interestingly, replicate populations of the same WT initially show similar trajectories, but may subsequently diverge along a growth rate versus yield trade-off.
Conclusions: We find that all our in silico WTs show the same anticipation effects \textemdash{} fitting the periodicity of a serial transfer protocol \textemdash{} but do so by a variety of mechanisms. Our results reveal new insights into the dynamics and relevant selection pressures in experimental evolution, but also highlight how, in an eco-evolutionary context, numerous mechanisms can evolve to the same end.},

  abstract = {The 306-kDa aspartate transcarbamoylase is a well studied regulatory enzyme, and it has emerged as a paradigm for understanding allostery and cooperative binding processes. Although there is a consensus that the cooperative binding of active site ligands follows the Monod\textendash Wyman\textendash Changeux (MWC) model of allostery, there is some debate about the binding of effectors such as ATP and CTP and how they influence the allosteric equilibrium between R and T states of the enzyme. In this article, the binding of substrates, substrate analogues, and nucleotides is studied, along with their effect on the R\textendash T equilibrium by using highly deuterated, 1H,13C-methyl-labeled protein in concert with methyl-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) NMR. Although only the T state of the enzyme can be observed in spectra of wild-type unliganded aspartate transcarbamoylase, binding of active-site substrates shift the equilibrium so that correlations from the R state become visible, allowing the equilibrium constant (L{${'}$}) between ligand-saturated R and T forms of the enzyme to be measured quantitatively. The equilibrium constant between unliganded R and T forms (L) also is obtained, despite the fact that the R state is ``invisible'' in spectra, by means of an indirect process that makes use of relations that emerge from the fact that ligand binding and the R\textendash T equilibrium are linked. Titrations with MgATP unequivocally establish that its binding directly perturbs the R\textendash T equilibrium, consistent with the Monod\textendash Wyman\textendash Changeux model. This study emphasizes the utility of modern solution NMR spectroscopy in understanding protein function, even for systems with aggregate molecular masses in the hundreds of kilodaltons.},

Modules are key units of adaptive evolution because organismal fitness depends on their performance. Yet, our understanding of adaptive evolution at the level of modules is limited. Theory predicts that in rapidly evolving populations, such as those of many microbes, natural selection focuses on improving one or a few modules at a time and its focus shifts to other modules as adaptation continues. Such shifts have never been directly observed, their timescale is unknown and the extent to which they limit the power of natural selection to improve any particular module is unclear. Here, we empirically characterize how natural selection improves the translation machinery (TM), one of the most essential cellular modules. To this end, we experimentally evolved populations of \emph{Escherichia coli} with genetically perturbed TMs for 1,000 generations. Populations with different TMs embarked on statistically distinct adaptive trajectories. Yet, in all genetic backgrounds, the focus of natural selection shifted away from the TM before its performance was fully restored. Our results show that shifts in the focus of selection can occur on time scales comparable to those of environmental fluctuations. Variability in selection pressures can delay the resumption of adaptation in stalled modules, which would make it difficult for evolution to fully optimize even essential modules.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The inherent complexity of even the simplest biological systems, however, often precludes achieving such predictive power. A prototypical example is the lac operon, one of the best-characterized genetic systems, which still poses serious challenges for understanding the results of combining its parts into novel setups. The reason is the pervasive complex hierarchy of events involved in gene regulation that extend from specific protein\textendash DNA interactions to the combinatorial assembly of nucleoprotein complexes. Here, we integrate such complexity into a few-parameter model to accurately predict gene expression from a few simple rules to connect the parts. The model accurately reproduces the observed transcriptional activity of the lac operon over a 10,000-fold range for 21 different operator setups, different repressor concentrations, and tetrameric and dimeric forms of the repressor. Incorporation of the calibrated model into more complex scenarios accurately captures the induction curves for key operator configurations and the temporal evolution of the {$\beta$}-galactosidase activity of cell populations.},

  abstract = {Escherichia coli and many other bacterial species can enter into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state, which is a survival strategy adopted by cells exposed to adverse environmental conditions. Pyruvate is known to be one factor that promotes resuscitation of VBNC cells. Here we studied the role of a pyruvate-sensing network, composed of the histidine kinase-response regulator systems BtsS/BtsR and YpdA/YpdB and the target gene btsT, encoding the high-affinity pyruvate/H+ symporter BtsT, in the resuscitation of VBNC E. coli K-12 cells after exposure to cold for 120 days. Analysis of the proteome of VBNC cells revealed upregulation, relative to exponentially growing cells, of BtsT and other proteins involved in pyruvate metabolism. Provision of pyruvate stimulated protein and DNA biosynthesis, and thus resuscitation, in wild-type but not btsSR ypdAB mutant VBNC cells. This result was corroborated by time-dependent tracking of the resuscitation of individual VBNC E. coli cells observed in a microfluidic system. Finally, transport assays revealed that 14C-labeled pyruvate was rapidly taken up into VBNC cells by BtsT. These results provide the first evidence that pyruvate is taken up as a carbon source for the resuscitation of VBNC E. coli cells.
IMPORTANCE Viable but nonculturable (VBNC) bacteria do not form colonies in standard medium but otherwise retain their metabolic activity and can express toxic proteins. Many bacterial genera, including Escherichia, Vibrio, and Listeria, have been shown to enter the VBNC state upon exposure to adverse conditions, such as low temperature, radiation, and starvation. Ultimately, these organisms pose a public health risk with potential implications for the pharmaceutical and food industries, as dormant organisms are especially difficult to selectively eliminate and VBNC bacteria can be resuscitated if placed in an environment with appropriate nutrition and temperature. Here we used a microfluidic system to monitor the resuscitation of single VBNC cells over time. We provide new molecular insights into the initiation of resuscitation by demonstrating that VBNC E. coli cells rapidly take up pyruvate with an inducible high-affinity transporter, whose expression is triggered by the BtsSR-YpdAB sensing network.},

  abstract = {Ammonium transport (Amt) proteins form a ubiquitous family of integral membrane proteins that specifically shuttle ammonium across membranes. In prokaryotes, archaea, and plants, Amts are used as environmental NH4+ scavengers for uptake and assimilation of nitrogen. In the eukaryotic homologs, the Rhesus proteins, NH4+/NH3 transport is used instead in acid\textendash base and pH homeostasis in kidney or NH4+/NH3 (and eventually CO2) detoxification in erythrocytes. Crystal structures and variant proteins are available, but the inherent challenges associated with the unambiguous identification of substrate and monitoring of transport events severely inhibit further progress in the field. Here we report a reliable in vitro assay that allows us to quantify the electrogenic capacity of Amt proteins. Using solid-supported membrane (SSM)-based electrophysiology, we have investigated the three Amt orthologs from the euryarchaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Af-Amt1 and Af-Amt3 are electrogenic and transport the ammonium and methylammonium cation with high specificity. Transport is pH-dependent, with a steep decline at pH values of {$\sim$}5.0. Despite significant sequence homologies, functional differences between the three proteins became apparent. SSM electrophysiology provides a long-sought-after functional assay for the ubiquitous ammonium transporters.},

Examples include the spread of beneficial mutations, chemical reactions, and the invasions by foreign species. In homogeneous environments, the alternative states are separated by a smooth front moving at a constant velocity. This simple picture can break down in structured environments such as tissues, patchy landscapes, and microfluidic devices. Habitat fragmentation can pin the front at a particular location or lock invasion velocities into specific values. Locked velocities are not sensitive to moderate changes in dispersal or growth and are determined by the spatial and temporal periodicity of the environment. The synchronization with the environment results in discontinuous fronts that propagate as periodic pulses. We characterize the transition from continuous to locked invasions and show that it is controlled by positive density-dependence in dispersal or growth. We also demonstrate that velocity locking is robust to demographic and environmental fluctuations and examine stochastic dynamics and evolution in locked invasions.},

This two-step selection procedure allows DNA to be modified without introducing an unwanted selectable marker at the modification site. All three strains contain an otherwise complete galactose operon, except for a precise deletion of the galK gene, and a defective temperature-sensitive lambda prophage that makes recombineering possible. SW105 and SW106 cells in addition carry l-arabinose-inducible Cre or Flp genes, respectively. The galK function can be selected both for and against. This feature greatly reduces the background seen in other negative-selection schemes, and galK selection is considerably more efficient than other related selection methods published. We also show how galK selection can be used to rapidly introduce point mutations, deletions and loxP sites into BAC DNA and thus facilitate functional studies of SNP and/or disease-causing point mutations, the identification of long-range regulatory elements and the construction of conditional targeting vectors.},

Humans are undoubtedly altering many geological processes on Earth\textemdash and have been for some time. But what is the stratigraphic evidence for officially distinguishing this new human-dominated time period, termed the ``Anthropocene,'' from the preceding Holocene epoch? Waters et al. review climatic, biological, and geochemical signatures of human activity in sediments and ice cores. Combined with deposits of new materials and radionuclides, as well as human-caused modification of sedimentary processes, the Anthropocene stands alone stratigraphically as a new epoch beginning sometime in the mid\textendash 20th century.
Science, this issue p. 10.1126/science.aad2622
Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDHumans are altering the planet, including long-term global geologic processes, at an increasing rate. Any formal recognition of an Anthropocene epoch in the geological time scale hinges on whether humans have changed the Earth system sufficiently to produce a stratigraphic signature in sediments and ice that is distinct from that of the Holocene epoch. Proposals for marking the start of the Anthropocene include an ``early Anthropocene'' beginning with the spread of agriculture and deforestation; the Columbian Exchange of Old World and New World species; the Industrial Revolution at \textasciitilde 1800 CE; and the mid-20th century ``Great Acceleration'' of population growth and industrialization.
ADVANCESRecent anthropogenic deposits contain new minerals and rock types, reflecting rapid global dissemination of novel materials including elemental aluminum, concrete, and plastics that form abundant, rapidly evolving ``technofossils.'' Fossil fuel combustion has disseminated black carbon, inorganic ash spheres, and spherical carbonaceous particles worldwide, with a near-synchronous global increase around 1950. Anthropogenic sedimentary fluxes have intensified, including enhanced erosion caused by deforestation and road construction. Widespread sediment retention behind dams has amplified delta subsidence.Geochemical signatures include elevated levels of polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticide residues, as well as increased 207/206Pb ratios from leaded gasoline, starting between \textasciitilde 1945 and 1950. Soil nitrogen and phosphorus inventories have doubled in the past century because of increased fertilizer use, generating widespread signatures in lake strata and nitrate levels in Greenland ice that are higher than at any time during the previous 100,000 years.Detonation of the Trinity atomic device at Alamogordo, New Mexico, on 16 July 1945 initiated local nuclear fallout from 1945 to 1951, whereas thermonuclear weapons tests generated a clear global signal from 1952 to 1980, the so-called ``bomb spike'' of excess 14C, 239Pu, and other artificial radionuclides that peaks in 1964.Atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations depart from Holocene and even Quaternary patterns starting at \textasciitilde 1850, and more markedly at \textasciitilde 1950, with an associated steep fall in {$\delta$}13C that is captured by tree rings and calcareous fossils. An average global temperature increase of 0.6o to 0.9oC from 1900 to the present, occurring predominantly in the past 50 years, is now rising beyond the Holocene variation of the past 1400 years, accompanied by a modest enrichment of {$\delta$}18O in Greenland ice starting at \textasciitilde 1900. Global sea levels increased at 3.2 {$\pm$} 0.4 mm/year from 1993 to 2010 and are now rising above Late Holocene rates. Depending on the trajectory of future anthropogenic forcing, these trends may reach or exceed the envelope of Quaternary interglacial conditions.Biologic changes also have been pronounced. Extinction rates have been far above background rates since 1500 and increased further in the 19th century and later; in addition, species assemblages have been altered worldwide by geologically unprecedented transglobal species invasions and changes associated with farming and fishing, permanently reconfiguring Earth's biological trajectory.
OUTLOOKThese novel stratigraphic signatures support the formalization of the Anthropocene at the epoch level, with a lower boundary (still to be formally identified) suitably placed in the mid-20th century. Formalization is a complex question because, unlike with prior subdivisions of geological time, the potential utility of a formal Anthropocene reaches well beyond the geological community. It also expresses the extent to which humanity is driving rapid and widespread changes to the Earth system that will variously persist and potentially intensify into the future. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/351/6269/aad2622/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Indicators of the Anthropocene in recent lake sediments differ markedly from Holocene signatures.These include unprecedented combinations of plastics, fly ash, radionuclides, metals, pesticides, reactive nitrogen, and consequences of increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. In this sediment core from west Greenland (69\r{}03'N, 49\r{}54'W), glacier retreat due to climate warming has resulted in an abrupt stratigraphic transition from proglacial sediments to nonglacial organic matter, effectively demarcating the onset of the Anthropocene. [Photo credit: J. P. Briner]
Human activity is leaving a pervasive and persistent signature on Earth. Vigorous debate continues about whether this warrants recognition as a new geologic time unit known as the Anthropocene. We review anthropogenic markers of functional changes in the Earth system through the stratigraphic record. The appearance of manufactured materials in sediments, including aluminum, plastics, and concrete, coincides with global spikes in fallout radionuclides and particulates from fossil fuel combustion. Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles have been substantially modified over the past century. Rates of sea-level rise and the extent of human perturbation of the climate system exceed Late Holocene changes. Biotic changes include species invasions worldwide and accelerating rates of extinction. These combined signals render the Anthropocene stratigraphically distinct from the Holocene and earlier epochs.},

The Hill coefficient is best thought of as an "interaction" coefficient, reflecting the extent of cooperativity among multiple ligand binding sites. Several relatively simple, physically plausible reaction schemes are shown here to produce a variety of ligand dose-response curve phenotypes more appropriately suited to modeling ligand-receptor interactions, especially if independent information about the stochiometry of the ligand-receptor interaction is available.},

  abstract = {Transposon mutagenesis with next-generation sequencing (TnSeq) is a powerful approach to annotate gene function in bacteria, but existing protocols for TnSeq require laborious preparation of every sample before sequencing. Thus, the existing protocols are not amenable to the throughput necessary to identify phenotypes and functions for the majority of genes in diverse bacteria. Here, we present a method, random bar code transposon-site sequencing (RB-TnSeq), which increases the throughput of mutant fitness profiling by incorporating random DNA bar codes into Tn5 and mariner transposons and by using bar code sequencing (BarSeq) to assay mutant fitness. RB-TnSeq can be used with any transposon, and TnSeq is performed once per organism instead of once per sample. Each BarSeq assay requires only a simple PCR, and 48 to 96 samples can be sequenced on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq system. We demonstrate the reproducibility and biological significance of RB-TnSeq with Escherichia coli, Phaeobacter inhibens, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Shewanella amazonensis, and Shewanella oneidensis. To demonstrate the increased throughput of RB-TnSeq, we performed 387 successful genome-wide mutant fitness assays representing 130 different bacterium-carbon source combinations and identified 5,196 genes with significant phenotypes across the five bacteria. In P. inhibens, we used our mutant fitness data to identify genes important for the utilization of diverse carbon substrates, including a putative d-mannose isomerase that is required for mannitol catabolism. RB-TnSeq will enable the cost-effective functional annotation of diverse bacteria using mutant fitness profiling.
IMPORTANCE A large challenge in microbiology is the functional assessment of the millions of uncharacterized genes identified by genome sequencing. Transposon mutagenesis coupled to next-generation sequencing (TnSeq) is a powerful approach to assign phenotypes and functions to genes. However, the current strategies for TnSeq are too laborious to be applied to hundreds of experimental conditions across multiple bacteria. Here, we describe an approach, random bar code transposon-site sequencing (RB-TnSeq), which greatly simplifies the measurement of gene fitness by using bar code sequencing (BarSeq) to monitor the abundance of mutants. We performed 387 genome-wide fitness assays across five bacteria and identified phenotypes for over 5,000 genes. RB-TnSeq can be applied to diverse bacteria and is a powerful tool to annotate uncharacterized genes using phenotype data.},

  abstract = {Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica is found in North America and much of Europe and causes the disease tularemia in humans and animals. An aquatic cycle has been described for this subspecies, which has caused waterborne outbreaks of tularemia in at least 10 countries. In this study, we sought to identify the mechanosensitive channel(s) required for the bacterium to survive the transition from mammalian hosts to freshwater, which is likely essential for the transmission of the bacterium between susceptible hosts. A single 165-amino-acid MscS-type mechanosensitive channel (FtMscS) was found to protect F. tularensis subsp. holarctica from hypoosmotic shock, despite lacking much of the cytoplasmic vestibule domain found in well-characterized MscS proteins from other organisms. The deletion of this channel did not affect virulence within the mammalian host; however, FtMscS was required to survive the transition from the host niche to freshwater. The deletion of FtMscS did not alter the sensitivity of F. tularensis subsp. holarctica to detergents, H2O2, or antibiotics, suggesting that the role of FtMscS is specific to protection from hypoosmotic shock. The deletion of FtMscS also led to a reduced average cell size without altering gross cell morphology. The mechanosensitive channel identified and characterized in this study likely contributes to the transmission of tularemia between hosts by allowing the bacterium to survive the transition from mammalian hosts to freshwater. IMPORTANCE The contamination of freshwater by Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica has resulted in a number of outbreaks of tularemia. Invariably, the contamination originates from the carcasses or excreta of infected animals and thus involves an abrupt osmotic downshock as the bacteria enter freshwater. How F. tularensis survives this drastic change in osmolarity has not been clear, but here we report that a single mechanosensitive channel protects the bacterium from osmotic downshock. This channel is functional despite lacking much of the cytoplasmic vestibule domain that is present in better-studied organisms such as \emph{Escherichia coli}; this report builds on previous studies that have suggested that parts of this domain are dispensable for downshock protection. These findings extend our understanding of the aquatic cycle and ecological persistence of F. tularensis, with further implications for mechanosensitive channel biology.},

This proposal was followed by an explication of allosteric behavior by Monod and colleagues. The operon model rationally depicted how genetic mechanisms can control metabolic events in response to environmental stimuli via coordinated transcription of a set of genes with related function (e.g. metabolism of lactose). The allosteric response found in the lactose repressor and many other proteins has been extended to a variety of cellular signaling pathways in all organisms. These two models have shaped our view of modern molecular biology and captivated the attention of a surprisingly broad range of scientists. More recently, the lactose repressor monomer was used as a model system for experimental and theoretical explorations of protein folding mechanisms. Thus, the lac system continues to advance our molecular understanding of genetic control and the relationship between sequence, structure and function.},

  abstract = {Determining whether and how a gene is transcribed are two of the central processes of life. The conceptual basis for understanding such gene regulation arose from pioneering biophysical studies in eubacteria. However, eukaryotic genomes exhibit vastly greater complexity, which raises questions not addressed by this bacterial paradigm. First, how is information integrated from many widely separated binding sites to determine how a gene is transcribed? Second, does the presence of multiple energy-expending mechanisms, which are absent from eubacterial genomes, indicate that eukaryotes are capable of improved forms of genetic information processing? An updated biophysical foundation is needed to answer such questions. We describe the linear framework, a graph-based approach to Markov processes, and show that it can accommodate many previous studies in the field. Under the assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium, we introduce a language of higher-order cooperativities and show how it can rigorously quantify gene regulatory properties suggested by experiment. We point out that fundamental limits to information processing arise at thermodynamic equilibrium and can only be bypassed through energy expenditure. Finally, we outline some of the mathematical challenges that must be overcome to construct an improved biophysical understanding of gene regulation.},

Some of the most recently categorized electroactive microorganisms became of interest to sustainable bioengineering practices. However, laboratories worldwide typically maintain electroactive microorganisms on soluble substrates, which often leads to a decrease or loss of the ability to effectively exchange electrons with solid electrode surfaces. In order to develop future sustainable technologies, we cannot rely solely on existing lab-isolates. Therefore, we must develop isolation strategies for environmental strains with electroactive properties superior to strains in culture collections. In this article, we provide an overview of the studies that isolated or enriched electroactive microorganisms from the environment using an anode as the sole electron acceptor (electricity-generating microorganisms) or a cathode as the sole electron donor (electricity-consuming microorganisms). Next, we recommend a selective strategy for the isolation of electroactive microorganisms. Furthermore, we provide a practical guide for setting up electrochemical reactors and highlight crucial electrochemical techniques to determine electroactivity and the mode of electron transfer in novel organisms.},

Among bacterial fatty acid synthases (FAS), the Escherichia coli FAS is perhaps the most well studied, but little is known about its steady-state kinetic behavior. Here we describe the reconstitution of E. coli FAS using purified protein components and report detailed kinetic analysis of this reconstituted system. When all ketosynthases are present at 1 {$\mu$}M, the maximum rate of free fatty acid synthesis of the FAS exceeded 100 {$\mu$}M/ min. The steady-state turnover frequency was not significantly inhibited at high concentrations of any substrate or cofactor. FAS activity was saturated with respect to most individual protein components when their concentrations exceeded 1 {$\mu$}M. The exceptions were FabI and FabZ, which increased FAS activity up to concentrations of 10 {$\mu$}M; FabH and FabF, which decreased FAS activity at concentrations higher than 1 {$\mu$}M; and holo-ACP and TesA, which gave maximum FAS activity at 30 {$\mu$}M concentrations. Analysis of the S36T mutant of the ACP revealed that the unusual dependence of FAS activity on holo-ACP concentration was due, at least in part, to the acyl-phosphopantetheine moiety. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction mixture further revealed medium and long chain fatty acyl-ACP intermediates as predominant ACP species. We speculate that one or more of such intermediates are key allosteric regulators of FAS turnover. Our findings provide a new basis for assessing the scope and limitations of using E. coli as a biocatalyst for the production of diesel-like fuels.},

We present evidence that the pstSCAB genes and the regulatory phoUB genes are transcribed from a single promoter that contains two PhoB binding sites and that transcription requires PhoB. S. meliloti strain 1021 (Rm1021) and its derivatives were found to carry a C deletion frameshift mutation in the pstC gene (designated pstC1021) that severely impairs activity of the PstSCAB Pi transport system. This mutation is absent in RCR2011, the parent of Rm1021. Correction of the pstC1021 mutation in Rm1021 by site-directed mutagenesis revealed that PstSCAB is a Pi-specific, high-affinity (Km, 0.2 {$\mu$}M), high-velocity (Vmax, 70 nmol/min/mg protein) transport system. The pstC1021 allele was shown to generate a partial pho regulon constitutive phenotype, in which transcription is activated by PhoB even under Pi-excess conditions that render PhoB inactive in a wild-type background. The previously reported symbiotic Fix- phenotype of phoCDET mutants was found to be dependent on the pstC1021 mutation, as Rm1021 phoCDET mutants formed small white nodules on alfalfa that failed to reduce N2, whereas phoCDET mutant strains with a corrected pstC allele (RmP110) formed pink nodules on alfalfa that fixed N2 like the wild type. Alfalfa root nodules formed by the wild-type RCR2011 strain expressed the low-affinity orfA-pit-encoded Pi uptake system and neither the pstSCAB genes nor the phoCDET genes. Thus, metabolism of alfalfa nodule bacteroids is not Pi limited.},

The latter is associated with growth arrest, and it is unclear how the ability to develop competence is stably maintained, despite its cost. To quantify the effect differentiation has on the competitive fitness of B. subtilis, we characterized the competition dynamics between strains with different probabilities of entering the K-state. The relative fitness decreased with increasing differentiation probability both during the stationary phase and during outgrowth. When exposed to antibiotics inhibiting cell wall synthesis, transcription, and translation, cells that differentiated into the K-state showed a selective advantage compared to differentiation-deficient bacteria; this benefit did not require transformation. Although beneficial, the K-state was not induced by sub-MIC concentrations of antibiotics. Increasing the differentiation probability beyond the wt level did not significantly affect the competition dynamics with transient antibiotic exposure. We conclude that the competition dynamics are very sensitive to the fraction of competent cells under benign conditions but less sensitive during antibiotic exposure, supporting the picture of stochastic differentiation as a fitness trade-off.},

  abstract = {Ancestors of the modern chicken were domesticated from members of the Gallus genus probably 7 to 8 thousand years ago in southeastern Asia. Subsequently, they spread globally for meat and egg production. In the chicken egg, there is a balance of numerous, high-quality nutrients, many of which are highly bioavailable. The egg confers a multitude of health benefits to consumers emphasizing its classification as a functional food. Current global per capita egg consumption estimates approach 9 kg annually but vary greatly on a regional basis. This review deals with global production, consumption, and management aspects such as hygiene, feeding, and housing. Management aspects play key roles in the composition, quality, food safety, and visual (consumer) appeal of the egg. Also the manipulation of egg nutrients and value for human health is discussed.},

This eliminates the possibility that cell shape is determined by this rate. Simulating Thy+ phenotype by adding deoxyguanosine resulted in shorter Rep- cells when growth was faster. This excludes a simple relationship between cell elongation and growth rate, but is consistent with a linear proportionality between the rate of surface synthesis and growth. Thymine limitation of fast-growing Thy- E. coli K-12 cells is shown to result in loss of their uniform shape and production of bizarre morphologies, apparently due to imbalanced synthesis of wall components.},

However, approaches based on the selection of individual sequences have not been entirely successful at the quantitative description of the distribution of structures and sequences in the protein universe because evolutionary pressure acts on the entire organism, rather than on a particular molecule. In parallel to this line of study, studies in population genetics and phenomenological molecular evolution established a mathematical framework to describe the changes in genome sequences in populations of organisms over time. Here, we review both microscopic (physics-based) and macroscopic (organism-level) models of protein-sequence evolution and demonstrate that bridging the two scales provides the most complete description of the protein universe starting from clearly defined, testable, and physiologically relevant assumptions.},

Here we report the purification and functional characterization of CysZ. Using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry, we have observed interactions between CysZ and its putative substrate sulfate. Additional sulfur-containing compounds from the cysteine synthesis pathway have also been analyzed for their abilities to interact with CysZ. Our results suggest that CysZ is dedicated to a specific pathway that assimilates sulfate for the synthesis of cysteine. Sulfate uptake via CysZ into E. coli whole cells and proteoliposome offers direct evidence of CysZ being able to mediate sulfate uptake. In addition, the cysteine synthesis pathway intermediate sulfite can interact directly with CysZ with higher affinity than sulfate. The sulfate transport activity is inhibited in the presence of sulfite, suggesting the existence of a feedback inhibition mechanism in which sulfite regulates sulfate uptake by CysZ. Sulfate uptake assays performed at different extracellular pH and in the presence of a proton uncoupler indicate that this uptake is driven by the proton gradient.},

The ammonium transport proteins (methylamine permeases/ammonium transporters/rhesus) are present in all domains of life; however, functional studies with members of this family have yielded controversial results with respect to the chemical identity ({$<$}img class="highwire-embed tex" alt="Math" src="https://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/highwire/pnas/101/49/17090/embed/tex-math-1.gif"/{$>$} or NH3) of the transported species. We have solved the structure of wild-type AmtB from Escherichia coli in two crystal forms at 1.8- and 2.1-\AA{} resolution, respectively. Substrate transport occurs through a narrow mainly hydrophobic pore located at the center of each monomer of the trimeric AmtB. At the periplasmic entry, a binding site for {$<$}img class="highwire-embed tex" alt="Math" src="https://www.pnas.org/sites/default/files/highwire/pnas/101/49/17090/embed/tex-math-2.gif"/{$>$} is observed. Two phenylalanine side chains (F107 and F215) block access into the pore from the periplasmic side. Further into the pore, the side chains of two highly conserved histidine residues (H168 and H318) bridged by a H-bond lie adjacent, with their edges pointing into the cavity. These histidine residues may facilitate the deprotonation of an ammonium ion entering the pore. Adiabatic free energy calculations support the hypothesis that an electrostatic barrier between H168 and H318 hinders the permeation of cations but not that of the uncharged NH3. The structural data and energetic considerations strongly indicate that the methylamine permeases/ammonium transporters/rhesus proteins are ammonia gas channels. Interestingly, at the cytoplasmic exit of the pore, two different conformational states are observed that might be related to the inactivation mechanism by its regulatory partner.},

  abstract = {RpoS, the stationary-phase sigma factor of \emph{\emph{Escherichia coli} coli}, is responsible for increased transcription of an array of genes when cells enter stationary phase and under certain stress conditions. RpoS is rapidly degraded during exponential phase and much more slowly during stationary phase; the resulting changes in RpoS accumulation play an important role in providing differential expression of RpoS-dependent gene expression. It has previously been shown that rapid degradation of RpoS during exponential growth depends on RssB (also called SprE and MviA), a protein with homology to the family of response regulators, and on the ClpXP protease. We find that RssB regulation of proteolysis does not extend to another ClpXP substrate, bacteriophage lambda O protein, suggesting that RssB acts on the specific substrate RpoS rather than on the protease. In addition, the activity of RpoS is down-regulated by RssB when degradation is blocked. In cells blocked for RpoS degradation by a mutation in clpP, cells devoid of RssB show a four- to fivefold-higher activity of an RpoS-dependent reporter fusion than cells overproducing RssB. Therefore, RssB allows specific environmental regulation of RpoS accumulation and may also modulate activity. The regulation of degradation provides an irreversible switch, while the regulation of activity may provide a second, presumably reversible level of control.},

We have studied the mutant protein FLP R308K in which the arginine residue at position 308 has been replaced by lysine. Although FLP R308K was previously reported to be defective in ligation of certain substrates (Pan, G., Luetke, K., and Sadowski, P. D., Mol. Cell. Biol. 13, 3167-3175, 1993b), we show in this work that the protein is able to ligate those substrates that it can cleave (cleavage-dependent ligation activity). FLP R308K is defective in in vitro recombination and in strand exchange. It is able to carry out strand exchange at one of the two cleavage sites of the FLP recognition target site (FRT site), but is defective in strand exchange at the other cleavage site. These results are consistent with a model in which wild-type FLP initiates recombination only at one of the two cleavage sites. FLP R308K may be defective in the initiation of recombination.},

Increased interest in this concept is attributed to problems associated with early life fast growth rate, especially in broilers fed ad libitum.

Factors that influence compensatory growth in the broiler chicken include the nature, severity and duration of undernutrition, as well as the age at the commencement of undernutrition and the degree and pattern of realimentation. Many studies have reported improvement in feed efficiency during compensatory growth in restricted-refed broilers. Broiler chickens undergoing compensatory growth also exhibit greater than normal feed intake relative to body weight and some associated digestive adaptation. The use of this concept to address problems associated with early life fast growth rate requires more studies of the nutrition of the broiler chicken during the period of growth compensation.},

  abstract = {The effect of commercial selection on the growth, efficiency, and yield of broilers was studied using 2 University of Alberta Meat Control strains unselected since 1957 and 1978, and a commercial Ross 308 strain (2005). Mixed-sex chicks (n = 180 per strain) were placed into 4 replicate pens per strain, and grown on a current nutritional program to 56 d of age. Weekly front and side profile photographs of 8 birds per strain were collected. Growth rate, feed intake, and measures of feed efficiency including feed conversion ratio, residual feed intake, and residual maintenance energy requirements were characterized. A nonlinear mixed Gompertz growth model was used to predict BW and BW variation, useful for subsequent stochastic growth simulation. Dissections were conducted on 8 birds per strain semiweekly from 21 to 56 d of age to characterize allometric growth of pectoralis muscles, leg meat, abdominal fat pad, liver, gut, and heart. A novel nonlinear analysis of covariance was used to test the hypothesis that allometric growth patterns have changed as a result of commercial selection pressure. From 1957 to 2005, broiler growth increased by over 400\%, with a concurrent 50\% reduction in feed conversion ratio, corresponding to a compound annual rate of increase in 42 d live BW of 3.30\%. Forty-two-day FCR decreased by 2.55\% each year over the same 48-yr period. Pectoralis major growth potential increased, whereas abdominal fat decreased due to genetic selection pressure over the same time period. From 1957 to 2005, pectoralis minor yield at 42 d of age was 30\% higher in males and 37\% higher in females; pectoralis major yield increased by 79\% in males and 85\% in females. Over almost 50 yr of commercial quantitative genetic selection pressure, intended beneficial changes have been achieved. Unintended changes such as enhanced sexual dimorphism are likely inconsequential, though musculoskeletal, immune function, and parent stock management challenges may require additional attention in future selection programs.},
