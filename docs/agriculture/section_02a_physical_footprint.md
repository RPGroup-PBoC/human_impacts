## The Physical Footprint of Agriculture
We will begin our exploration of the three major impacts of human impacts by
considering the key observable features, namely the total amount of biomass
under human agriculture management and the space in which it all happens. This
section will be broken into several parts. First, we will focus on "livestock by
the numbers" and see if we can make sense of the recorded numbers of animals and
their agricultural products on a yearly basis. With a handle on the total number
of livestock processed and/or reared per year, we will then turn our attention
towards estimating the scale of crops needed to feed this livestock population
in addition to the crops needed to satisfy the typical human diet. With a
feeling in place for the numbers, we will turn our attention to the
consideration of the spatial extent of farm land.
