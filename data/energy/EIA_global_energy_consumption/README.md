# EIA Global Energy Consumption and Production

## Description 
This dataset contains information about the total amount of production and consumption of
various forms of energy for human use. Data is given for each country and processed into
aggregates for continental regions defined according to conventions used by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Data is given over the period from 1980
to 2018.

* **Sources**: The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).

* **Original License**: CC-BY-4.0
* **Bias**: The EIA is run and organized by the United States government. They provide detailed
accounts of their sourcing and estimation methods for each value in their dataset. It is unlikely
that thus organization has much bias or a conflict of interest, although data reported by countries
may have a conflict of interest. 

## Notes
> * Values for some years may be incomplete.
> * Only production is tracked for nuclear and renewable sources of energy, which cannot be transported
over long distances due to the limitations of electrical storage capabilities.
> * Aggregated production and consumption numbers may differ slightly for fossil fuels due to differences
in reporting and fuel loss incurred during transportation and storage.
> * Energy consumption per year is reported in watts and represents primary energy consumption. This is distinct
from "useful" energy usage due to inefficiencies in the conversion of stored chemical or other forms
of energy into useful work.
> * Oil production volumes exclude refinery processing gain, which is included in the original source material.
> * The generation values given for nuclear, hydroelectric and other non-fossil fuel sources of energy are given
in terms of input-equivalent scaling and not in terms of power generated, which is smaller by a factor of 2-3.
Fossil fuel sources of energy are generally inefficient, so that only a fraction of the total energy consumption is
used for useful work. Non-fossil fuel sources are generally more efficient, so in order to provide a level comparison
across different sources, their generation values are rescaled as if they had similar efficiencies to fossil fuel
sources.
