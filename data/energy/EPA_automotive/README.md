# Automotive trends in the United States of America (EPA)

## Description
This entry includes automotive trends for vehicles delivered for sale in the U.S. in the period 1975-2020.

## Key Numbers

Average fuel economy of all light-duty road vehicles (2020): ≈ 25.69 MPG

## Notes

The Trends database has been maintained by EPA since 1975 and is updated annually to include the most up to date data available for all model years. All data are based on production volumes delivered for sale in the U.S. by model year, and may vary from publicized data based on calendar year sales.

Most of the data are reported as fleetwide averages, reflecting arithmetic production-weighted averages of individual CO2 emissions values and harmonic production-weighted averages of individual fuel economy values. Major methodological changes are generally propagated backwards through the historical database in order to maintain the integrity of long-term trends.

There are two categories of CO2 emissions and fuel economy data: compliance data and estimated real-world data. Compliance data are measured using laboratory tests required by law for CAFE and adopted by EPA for GHG compliance. Compliance data are measured using EPA city and highway test procedures (the “2-cycle” tests), and fleetwide averages are calculated by weighting the city and highway test results by 55% and 45%, respectively. These procedures are required for compliance; however, they no longer accurately reflect real-world driving. Compliance data may also encompass optional performance credits and adjustments that manufacturers can use towards meeting their emissions standards.

The second category is estimated real-world (previously called “adjusted”) data, which is measured using additional laboratory tests to capture a wider range of operating conditions (including hot and cold weather, higher speeds, and faster accelerations) encountered by an average driver. This expanded set of tests is referred to as “5-cycle” testing. City and highway results are weighted 43% city and 57% highway, consistent with fleetwide driver activity data. The city and highway values are the same values found on new vehicle fuel economy labels, however the label combined value is weighted 55% city and 45% highway. Unlike compliance data, the method for calculating real-world data has evolved over time, along with technology and driving habits.
