# BP Statistical Review Global Energy Use – Fossil Extraction

## Description
This dataset contains data of the volume (oil and gas) or mass (coal) of fossil
fuels extracted from years 1965 - 2019. Units of barrels (for oil) were converted to cubic meters.

## Key Numbers

* Global natural gas extraction (2019) ≈ 4.0 trillion cubic meters
* Global oil extraction (2019) ≈ 5.5 billion cubic meters
* Global coal extraction (2019) ≈ 5.9 billion tonnes

* **Bias**: BP is a major energy company specializing in many forms of energy
  resource management and mining. They are most well known for their major
  player status in the petroleum industry. This data set, despite this obvious
  conflict of interest, appears to be robust and the numbers make sense with
  intuition. This data set is also used extensively by Our World in Data, which
  itself has high standards for what data is used.

## Notes
Processed data file was manipulated manually into a long-form tidy format where
each row corresponds to a single measurement of extraction volume or mass for a given year.
Data for natural gas were reported in cubic meters. Coal data were reported in tonnes.
Data for oil were converted from barrels to cubic meters as one barrel = 0.159 cubic meters (source: https://apps.cer-rec.gc.ca/Conversion/conversion-tables.aspx?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA)
