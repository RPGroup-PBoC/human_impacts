# Resource Requirements per MCal of Livestock 

## Description 
This dataset corresponds to the results presented in Eshel et al. 2014. Many of these data come from other sources and we direct the reader to the manuscript for further information. These data represent the summarized data shown in Figs. 2 — 4 of the source material.
