Historical growth in global terrestrial gross primary production derived from carbonyl sulfide measurements.

## Description

Growth in terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) during the period 1900-2013. GPP is defined as the amount of carbon dioxide that is taken up by land plants through photosynthesis. Increments in GPP may represent a negative feedback for climate change, reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. However, an increase in GPP may not necessarily represent a higher CO<sub>2</sub> sink, since the net effect of plants on atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> also depends on respiration, which releases CO<sub>2</sub> and partially offsets GPP. The difference between GPP and respiration is referred to as net primary production.

## Key Numbers
Growth in global terrestrial gross primary production (1900-2013): ≈ 31 ± 5 %

## Notes

The estimate is obtained using a top-down approach, constrained by global atmospheric concentrations of carbonyl sulfide (COS), an atmospheric tracer. The historical trend of COS concentration was obtained from ice-core and firn measurements in Antarctica. The GPP growth is then derived using a Bayesian Monte Carlo analysis of historical trends of the global COS sink due to plant photosynthesis. The reported value represents the range of GPP growth that maximizes the likelihood of the COS concentration observations. The uncertainty band represents the 95% confidence interval derived from the analysis.
