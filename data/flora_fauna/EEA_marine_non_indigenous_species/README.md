# Number of non-indigenous species in European Seas

## Description
Dataset containing the cumulative number and trends in the introduction and recording of marine non-indigenous species (NIS) in the regional seas of Europe since 1949. The unit of measurement is the number of NIS per taxonomic group (primary producers, invertebrates and vertebrates) at pan-European and regional sea levels, expressed as the number of new NIS every 6 years.

## Key Numbers
Number of non-indigenous species in European Seas (2017): ≈ 1039

Number of non-indigenous vertebrate species in European Seas (2017): ≈ 151

* **Bias**: Miscategorising alien species as native is not rare. Many pseudo-indigenous species occur in the Mediterranean, precisely because many old taxonomic works originated in the Mediterranean. There are many records of cryptogenic species and phylogenetic studies have revealed that some of them are true aliens. For these reasons, the data reported are likely an underestimate of the total number of NIS.

* `cumulative-number-of-non-indigenous-2.csv`: original data source, last modified 10 Dec 2019.

* `non_ind_species_europe.csv`: processed data. Data reported for each period in the original source is reported here for the last year of the period. Thus, new NIS should be interpreted as introduced between the year reported and the previous year in the time series, starting in 1949.

## Notes
Biological invasions are widely recognised as one of the main threats to biodiversity, alongside habitat destruction and pollution. Non-indigenous species (NIS), also known as alien species, are species introduced to areas outside their native range. NIS are defined as any live specimen of a species, subspecies or lower taxon of animals, plants, fungi or micro-organisms introduced outside their natural range.

Geographical coverage: Europe’s seas. Marine and estuarine species data were extracted from the working database and grouped by country at pan-European level (i.e. EU and non-EU). Country data were further aggregated at regional sea level, following the geographical delineation of the regional seas surrounding Europe. Sub-regions of the regional seas: Baltic Sea (no subdivision), North-East Atlantic Ocean (Greater North Sea, Celtic Sea, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast), Mediterranean Sea (Western Mediterranean Sea, Ionian Sea, Central Mediterranean Sea, Adriatic Sea, Aegean-Levantine Sea), Black Sea and Iceland Sea.

The year of introduction is based on reported first collection dates but does not necessarily imply the true year of introduction, which may be years earlier. For 2016-17, the rate of introduction is underestimated; due to a time lapse between observation and publication, species collected in the 2016-17 period are expected to be published in the next 2 years. The uncertainties behind data sets on NIS reflect the challenge of adequately discovering and reporting new species or mapping their distribution, but also of compiling data at a national level (Zenetos et al., 2017).
