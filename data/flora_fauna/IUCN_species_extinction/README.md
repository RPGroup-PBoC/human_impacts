# IUCN List of Extinct Species

## Description 
This dataset lists the number of species in a variety of classes and orders which 
have been assessed by the IUCN and have been determined to be extinct, probably extinct,
extinct in the wild, or probably extinct in the wild. This dataset also computes 
the fold-change difference in number of species observed to be extinct relative to 
the expected number of extinctions given a background rate of 2 E / MSY.

## Key Numbers
| Kingdom | Definition | Observed | Expected | Fold-change | 
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Animalia | Extinct Only | 762 | 80 | 9.5 |
|Animalia | Extinct + Extinct in Wild | 800 | 80 | 10 |
|Animalia | Extinct + Prob. Extinct | 1370 | 80 |17 | 
|Animalia | Extinct + Prob Extinct + Extinct in Wild + Prob. Extinct in Wild | 1418 | 80 | 18|
|Plantae | Extinct Only | 120 | 45 | 2.5 |
|Plantae | Extinct + Extinct in Wild | 159 | 45 | 3.5 |
|Plantae | Extinct + Prob Extinct | 444 | 45 | 9.8 |
|Plantae | Extinct + Prob Extinct + Extinct in Wild + Prob Extinct in Wild | 522 | 45 | 11

* **Bias**: The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is an intergovernmental and
  non-governmental organization with 1400 members. The mission statement of the organization is 
  to "influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable". They go to great 
  efforts to make their assessment procedure and statistics available to the public 
  and clearly stated. They have been criticized for prioritizing nature over
  indigenous populations and for having a strong focus on northern hemisphere biodiversity. 
  IUCN collaborates and has close associations with commercial and some governmental 
  organizations, leading to criticism from some sectors of conservation and 
  worries of included bias.


## Notes 

The IUCN provides definitions of what genera are included in their definition of 
kingdoms. This has been pasted from their website verbatim.

IUCN Red List Categories: EX - Extinct, EW - Extinct in the Wild, CR - Critically Endangered (includes CR(PE) and CR(PEW)), EN - Endangered, VU - Vulnerable, LR/cd - Lower Risk/conservation dependent, NT - Near Threatened (includes LR/nt - Lower Risk/near threatened), DD - Data Deficient, LC - Least Concern (includes LR/lc - Lower Risk/least concern).

CR(PE) & CR(PEW): The tags 'Possibly Extinct' and 'Possibly Extinct in the Wild' have been developed to identify CR species that are likely already extinct (or extinct in the wild), but require more investigation to confirm this. NOTE that these are not IUCN Red List Categories; they are tags that can be attached to the CR category to highlight those taxa that are possibly extinct. They are included in the above table to indicate a plausible upper estimate for number of recently extinct species on The IUCN Red List.

Animal classes (kingdom Animalia): Mammalia (mammals), Aves (birds), Reptilia (reptiles), Amphibia (amphibians), Cephalaspidomorphi (lampreys), Myxini (hagfishes), Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes: sharks, skates, rays and chimaeras), Actinopterygii (bony fishes and ray-finned fishes), Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes: coelacanths, lungfishes, etc.), Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers), Echinoidea (heart urchins, sand dollars, sea urchins, starfishes, etc.), Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, etc.), Chilopoda (centipedes), Diplopoda (millipedes), Entognatha (diplurans, proturans, and springtails), Branchiopoda (clam shrimps, fairy shrimps, tadpole shrimps, and water fleas), Malacostraca (crabs, lobsters, shrimps, krill, woodlice, etc.), Maxillopoda (barnacles, copepods, etc.), Ostracoda (ostracods: seed shrimps), Insecta (insects), Merostomata (horshoe crabs), Onychophora (velvet worms), Clitellata (earthworms, leeches, etc.), Polychaeta (bristle worms), Bivalvia (bivalve molluscs: mussels, clams, oysters, etc.), Gastropoda (gastropod molluscs: snails and slugs), Cephalopoda (nautiluses, octopuses, squids, and cuttlefishes), Enopla (ribbon worms), Turbellaria (flukes, tapeworms, planarians, etc.), Anthozoa (sea anemones, stony corals and soft corals), Hydrozoa (hydrozoans: freshwater jelly, freshwater polyps, Portuguese man o' war, etc).
