# Global anthropogenic erosion

## Description 
This dataset contains modeling-based estimates for the cumulative mass of sediment produced 
via agriculture over the entire holocene, beginning at the advent of agriculture. This dataset 
also includes a point-estimate for the contemporary rate of sediment production through 
accelerated erosion. 

## Key Numbers
Global contemporary sediment production rate ≈ 11.7 Pg / yr
