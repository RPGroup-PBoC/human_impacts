# Drivers of global forest loss

## Description
This data reflects the drivers of global forest loss for the time period of
2001 - 2015.

## Key Numbers

| Driver | Fraction of Total Loss | Area [MHa] |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Commodity-driven deforestation | ≈ 25 % | ≈ 5|
| Shifting agriculture | 21 % | ≈ 1 |
| Forestry | ≈ 31% | ≈ 6.2 |
| Wildfire | ≈ 22% | ≈ 4.4 |
| Urbanization | ≤ 1% | ≈ 0.2|

## Notes 
* The data set for annual commodity-driven deforestation was digitize form the bar plot in Figure 3A. Values should be taken as approximate values only.
* Data for fractional breakdown of drivers was computed from the reported fractions in Table 1. The text states that ≈ 5 Mha per year is deforested for commodity-driven forestation. Using the reported value of ≈ 25% of the total corresponds to commodity-driven deforestation, we can calculate that a total of ≈ 20 Mha of forest area is lost.
