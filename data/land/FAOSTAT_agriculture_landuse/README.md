   lot of information pertaining to their data collection methods, estimations methods,

## Notes 
"Agriculture" is defined by the FAO as "'[L]and under temporary crops', 'Land
under temporary meadows and pastures', 'Land with temporary fallow', 'Land
under permanent crops', 'Land under permanent meadows and pastures', and
'Land under protective cover'. This category includes tilled and fallow land,
and naturally grown permanent meadows and pastures used for grazing, animal
feeding or agricultural purpose. Scattered land under farm buildings, yards
and their annexes, and permanently uncultivated land, such as uncultivated
patches, banks, footpaths, ditches, headlands and shoulders are traditionally
included. "
