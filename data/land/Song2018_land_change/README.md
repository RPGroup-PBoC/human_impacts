## Description

Quantification of land cover change as measured by satellite data at 0.05&deg; &times; 0.05&deg; spatial resolution. Land cover change is defined in terms of three main classes: Tree canopy (vegetation over 5 m in height), short vegetation (vegetation less than 5 m in height) and bare ground.

## Key Numbers
Average annual net change in tree canopy cover (1982-2016): ≈ 6.6 &times; 10<sup>4</sup> km<sup>2</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>.
