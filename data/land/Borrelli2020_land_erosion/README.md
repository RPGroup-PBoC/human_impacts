# Agricultural Erosion Rate in 2015


## Description 
This dataset contains the reported values for estimated erosion rate and uncertainty 
due to agricultural land, including annual crops, permanent crops, and managed pasture. 
It also reports this value as a fraction of the total global erosion rate. 

## Key Numbers
Total 2015 erosion rate ≈ 4.3 (+9.2, -7) Pg / yr
Agricultural 2015 erosion rate ≈ 23.4 (+5.3, -4.1) Pg / yr

## Notes 
This work reports the estimated erosional output in 2015 and the predicted erosional output in 2070 based 
on three different models of erosion progression. They use their models to make estimates for the values
in 2015 and compare them to direct observations. In general, their estimates fall within reasonable agreement 
with direct measurements as well as with other modeling approaches from other works.
