# Nationally designated terrestrial protected areas in Europe

## Description
Dataset containing the area and number of terrestrial protected areas in Europe, from 1838 to 2020. The indicator illustrates the rate of growth in the number and cumulative area of nationally designated terrestrial protected areas over time. Data are provided in surface area (km<sup>2</sup>) and number of nationally designated protected areas.

## Key Numbers
Extent of terrestrial protected area in EEA countries (2020): â‰ˆ 1.8 &times; 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup>

## Source Information
* **Source Website**: European Environment Agency (EEA) Indicator Assessment
* **URL**: [homepage](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/nationally-designated-protected-areas-1/assessment), [dataset](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/daviz/growth-of-the-nationally-designated-5#tab-googlechartid_googlechartid_chart_111)

* **Bias**: The indicator does not describe the quality of management or whether or not the areas are protected from incompatible uses. The indicator needs to be complemented by information on management effectiveness or other elements that would indicate the potential of the designated area to protect biodiversity.

## Notes
A 'nationally designated protected area' is an area protected by a national legislation. If a country has included sites designated under international agreements such as the EU Birds and Habitats Directives, or the Bern or Ramsar Convention in its legislation, the corresponding protected sites, such as the Natura 2000, Emerald or Ramsar sites, of this country are included in the indicator.

Data is available for the European Union countries plus the United Kingdom (EU-27+UK), and for the [countries](https://www.eea.europa.eu/countries-and-regions) that are part of the European Environment Agency (EEA), plus the United Kingdom (EEA-38+UK). The EEA-38+UK countries include the European Union Member States, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo (under UNSCR 1244/99), Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.
