# Global Carbon Budget

## Description
The Global Carbon Budget contains data on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil-fuel use and land-use change.

## Key Numbers
* CO<sub>2</sub> emissions total (2018): ≈ 11.5 GtC / yr (≈ 42.1 GtCO<sub>2</sub> / yr)
* CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (2018): ≈ 10 GtC / yr (≈ 36.6 GtCO<sub>2</sub> / yr)
* CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from land-use change (2018): ≈ 1.5 GtC / yr (≈ 5.5 GtCO<sub>2</sub> / yr)
* Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> growth rate (2018): ≈ 5.1 GtC / yr (≈ 18.8 GtCO<sub>2</sub> / yr)

* **Bias**: These data are mostly from original publications but collected and curated by the Global Carbon Project, a Global Research Project of Future Earth and a research partner of the World Climate Research Programme. No inherent bias seems to be present.

## Notes
The data were processed by converting the source tab "Global Carbon Budget" to csv. Please see the source data for more detailed information. Values are present in units of GtC / yr but can easily be converted to Gt CO<sub>2</sub> / yr as 1 gigatonne C = 3.664 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.
