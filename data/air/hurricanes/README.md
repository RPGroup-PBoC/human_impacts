**Description**

This contains data on the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) in the North Atlantic basin from 1851-2019.
The index is computed by summing the squares of the maximum sustained wind speed (in knots) in all cyclones in a season at six-hour intervals. The total is then divided by 10^4 to make the numbers more manageable.

**Source Information**

1851-2016 data: http://psl.noaa.gov/data/timeseries/monthly/ACE/

2017-2019 data: ACE values of all hurricanes manually aggregated from http://climatlas.com/tropical/

**Notes**

Plotting the ten-year rolling average of the data indicates a cycle of varying intensity of Atlantic hurricane seasons with a period of roughly 70 years.
