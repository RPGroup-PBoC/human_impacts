# GLOBAL Land-Ocean Temperature Index

## Description
The GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4) dataset contains global surface temperature anomaly data relative to reference years 1951-1980.

## Key Numbers
Global surface temperature anomaly (2019): 0.99 °C,
Global surface temperature anomaly for the warmest year (2016): 1.02 °C

## Notes
The data were manually processed by retaining column "J-D", which describes the global annual temperature anomaly, and converting it to °C.
