* **Bias**: This data set comes from the Oklahoma State Department of
  Agriculture. While they do not have a direct stake in presenting the data
  (i.e. they aren't selling pork or pork processing products), the department of
  agriculture is invested in promoting pork processing and consumption. This
  dataset may be mildly biased in presenting a high yield of beef per carcass,
  though the numbers make sense.
