* **Original License**: There is no license provided with the data. Website is

  must be acquired elsewhere.
* **Bias**: This data is provided by PorkCheckoff -- A website run by the
  National Pork Board which keeps track of the Legislative PorkCheckoff tax
  program. This is *not* a governmental agency, but is involved in brokering (I
  think) and managing legislative interactions with the pork industry. There is
  a vested interest the portrayal of the pork industry in a positive light. It
  is unlikely that data on the lifecycle of hog is misrepresented, though
  details about diet, rate of mass accrual, or humanitarian conditions may be
  presented with bias. 

  According to their website: "Checkoff-funded promotions are designed to
  increase domestic pork sales through consumer, retail and food service
  outreach. Foreign promotions for U.S. pork funded by the Pork Checkoff have
  helped to move the U.S. from a net importer to a net exporter of pork."
