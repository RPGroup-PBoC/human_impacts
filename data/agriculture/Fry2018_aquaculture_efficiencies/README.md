# Feed-to-Edible Conversion Efficiencies of Aquacultural Species and Livestock in the US 

## Description 
This dataset corresponds to the feed-to-edible conversion efficiencies of a variety of aquacultural species as well as beef, poultry and pork presented in Fry et al. (2018).

## Notes

Values are computed from estimated inputs fed directly to food-producing animals to produce a unit of edible mass. This estimate does not consider the effect of early mortality, feeding breeding animals or waste in the calculation. Therefore, the values presented here should be viewed as an overestimate of the actual efficiency.

The values given for terrestrial livestock are given by the Corrigendum of the article, due to inaccuracies in the calculation of the original article for these species.
