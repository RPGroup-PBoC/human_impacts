# Harvested Fish Mass By Source and Species

## Description 
This data set gives representations of the total mass of harvested fish (see
notes) from wild capture and aquaculture at three different resolutions: by
country, by species, and in total.

## Key Numbers
* Total cultured production (2018) ≈ 82 Mt

* Total captured production (2018) ≈ 96 Mt

* Total production (2018) ≈ 180 Mt

**Top captured species in 2018 (by mass)**

| Species | Mass (Mt) |
| :--: | :--: |
| Peruvian Anchovy | ≈ 7 Mt |
| Alaska Pollock | ≈ 4 Mt |
| Skipjack tuna | ≈ 3 Mt |
| Atlantic herring | ≈ 2 Mt |
| Blue whiting | ≈ 2 Mt |


**Top cultured species in 2018 (by mass)**

| Species | Mass (Mt) |
| :--: | :--: |
| Grass Carp | ≈ 6 Mt | 
| Whiteleg shrimp | ≈ 5 Mt | 
| Silver carp | ≈ 5 Mt | 
| Nile tilapia | ≈ 4.5 Mt |
| Common carp | ≈ 4 Mt |

## Notes
* This data only records organisms denoted as being "fish, crustaceans, and molluscs  etc" and does not include mammals, reptiles, or lower organisms such as corals and sponges. Furthermore, it does not contain aquatic plantae, which make up a sizable portion of aquaculture (Japanese kelp, specifically). Most data sets comparing capture fisheries and aquaculture including aquatic plants in the reported production mass, such as that reported by [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-aquaculture).
