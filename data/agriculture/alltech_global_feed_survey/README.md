# Alltech Global Feed Survey (2013-2020)

## Description 
This dataset describes the global livestock and pet feed production broken down
by animal and country (top N producing countries)

## Key Numbers

| Feed Category | Approximate Feed Mass (million tonnes) | Percent of Global Feed Production |
| :-- | :--: |:--:|
| Aquaculture | ≈ 40 | ≈ 3% |
| Beef Cattle | ≈ 100 | ≈ 10 % |
| Dairy Cattle | ≈ 100 | ≈ 10 % |
| Swine | ≈ 250 | ≈ 20% |
| Egg Poultry | ≈ 150 | ≈ 15% |
| Boiler Poultry | ≈ 250 | ≈ 30% |
| Pet | ≈ 20 | ≈ 2% |
| Horse | ≈ 10 | ≈ 1% |

Total annual feed production ≈ 1 billion tonnes

Top 5 countries = China, USA, Brazil, Mexico, India

* **Original License**: The original license is unclear. As the data is freely
  available to the press and summarized, we presume it to be CC-BY 4.0. Contact
  may be necessary for inclusion in dataset. 
* **Bias**: This dataset comes from a privately-held corporation which
  specializes in agricultural commerce, selling services, supplements, and other
  items. They hold a yearly conference and produce yearly surveys about global
  feed and supplement use. The numbers appear to be reasonable with
  back-of-the-envelope estimates, though other sources should be used to
  validate their findings.


## Notes 
Data for feed breakdown by species/use is accessible only via PDF, the originals
of which are stored in the `source` folder. Data for the per country breakdown
come from a combination of the PDF data sources and interactive visualizations
on the Alltech website. It is not possible to find per-country breakdowns for a
few of the years, meaning that data is somewhat incomplete.
