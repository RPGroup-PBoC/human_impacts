# Feed-to-Food Conversion Efficiencies of Livestock in the US 

## Description 
This dataset corresponds to the conversion efficiencies of beef, poultry, pork, dairy and eggs presented in Shepon et al. (2016). Data are also included for the feed intake per kg of edible weight for beef, poultry and pork. These data represent the summary values shown in Table 1 of the source material.

## Notes

Feed composition data are derived from NRC data (National Research Council), and the mean American diet is the diet from the average American over 2000-2010 (US Department of Agriculture) with approximate loss-adjusted food consumption of 2500 kcal and 70 g of protein per day.
