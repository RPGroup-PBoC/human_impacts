# FAOSTAT Annual Crop Production and Area Harvested

## Description 
This dataset from the FAO reports the tonnage of primary crops harvested for
human consumption as well as the area from which it was harvested per annum.
This dataset does *not* account for the production of hay/silage/cereals
ultimately used for livestock feed. 

## Key Numbers
Below is a ranking of the top 11 crops accounting for > 75% of total crops
harvested. The table is rank ordered by area harvested and not mass harvested. 

| Quantity | Mass produced Mt| Area Harvested MHa|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Cereals, total | ≈ 2800 | ≈ 700 |
| Wheat | ≈ 725 | ≈220 | 
| Maize | ≈ 1000 | ≈200 |
| Rice, paddy | ≈ 750 | ≈ 160 |
| Soybeans | ≈ 300 | ≈ 115 |
| Vegetables, Primary (see note) | ≈1000 | ≈ 55 | 
| Barley | ≈ 140 | ≈ 50 |
| Sorghum | ≈ 60 | ≈ 40 |
| Rapeseed | ≈ 70 | ≈ 35 | 
| Seed cotton | ≈ 75 | ≈ 33 |
| Millet | ≈ 30 | ≈ 30 |
| Sugar Cane | ≈1800 | ≈ 25|

  intentional bias, but differences in reporting by country and differing

  underestimates of certain categories. 



## Notes

See this important note with regard to primary vegetables:


> Statistics on vegetables are not available in many countries, and the
  coverage of the reported data differs from country to country. In general, it
  appears that the estimates refer to crops grown in field and market gardens
  mainly for sale, thus excluding crops cultivated in kitchen gardens or small
  family gardens mainly for household consumption. In Austria, for example,
  reported data refer to field crops only and in Cuba they refer to procurement
  from State and private farms. Production from family and other small gardens
  not included in current statistical surveys constitutes quite an important
  part of the estimated total production in certain countries: for example,
  Austria, France,Germany,Italy and the United States. For the reasons
  mentioned above, continental and world totals are far from representative of
  the total area and production of the different kinds of vegetables.
  Production data include data on vegetables shown separately, as well as data
  on all other kinds of vegetables. They also include estimates for
  non-reporting countries and, when available, production of non- commercial
  crops for countries reporting only production for sale.
