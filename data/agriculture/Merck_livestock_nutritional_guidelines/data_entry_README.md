# Merck Veterinary Livestock Nutritional Guidelines

## Description 
This dataset contains information about the nutritional requirements for rearing
various kinds of livestock. This dataset serves as guidelines, not *actual*
nutrients produced/consumed. This dataset should then serve somewhat as a tool
to sanity check numbers of produced feed (fodder and forage). Processed dataset
was assembled by hand. PDFs of the accessed webpages are stored in the `source`
directory. 

## Key Numbers
Data is still being manually processed, will put numbers here when complete. 

## Source Information
Fill out the table below for each data set. 

* **Source Website**:
  [Merck Manual -- Veterinary Manual](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/management-and-nutrition)
  accessed webpages are stored 
* **URL**: PDFs of the source webpages (accessed July/August 2020) are stored in
  the `source` folder. 
* **Original License**: There is no specified license, though they do request
  that you contact Merck Manuals for permission to reuse content from their
  website or published materials. Their contact info is:  merckmanualpermissions@merck.com
* **Bias**: Merck Veterinary Manual allegedly serves as a trusted source for
  both human and veterinary medicine. They sell a print copy of their various
  manual editions. They do not appear to have an agenda beyond providing best
  practices for maintenance and care of animals. They are certified as a [HON
  Code Trustworthy Source](https://www.hon.ch/cgi-bin/HONcode/principles.pl?English) of health information.
