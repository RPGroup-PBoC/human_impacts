## Notes
Values for the last year reported are preliminary, pending recalibrations of standard gases and other quality control steps. 

The Global Monitoring Division of NOAA’s Earth System Research Laboratory has measured methane since 1983 at a globally distributed network of air sampling sites (Dlugokencky et al., 1994). A global average is constructed by first smoothing the data for each site as a function of time, and then smoothed values for each site are plotted as a function of latitude for 48 equal time steps per year. Global means are calculated from the latitude plot at each time step (Masarie and Tans, 1995). Global averages are important for methane concentrations, as concentration can vary substantially between sites (e.g. Southern Hemisphere vs Northern Hemisphere, as shown in Figure 6.3. of Chapter 6 of the 5th IPCC report).
