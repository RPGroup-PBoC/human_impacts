# Global Methane Budget

## Description
The Global Methane Budget contains data on CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources.

## Key Numbers
* CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from anthropogenic sources (2017): ≈ 0.4 Gt CH<sub>4</sub> / yr
* CH<sub>4</sub> emissions from natural sources (2017): ≈ 0.3 Gt CH<sub>4</sub> / yr
* Atmospheric CH<sub>4</sub> growth rate (2017): ≈ 17 Mt CH<sub>4</sub> / yr

## Source Information

* **Original License**: Saunois, M. et al. (2020). The global methane budget 2000–2017. Earth system science data, 12(3), 1561-1623.
* **Bias**: These data are mostly from original publications but collected and curated by the Global Carbon Project, a Global Research Project of Future Earth and a research partner of the World Climate Research Programme. No inherent bias seems to be present.

## Notes
The data were processed by tidying Table 2 of the publication and retaining the categories needed for this analysis. See the source dataset for more granular information and uncertainties. "Atmospheric growth is given in the same unit (Tg CH4 / yr), based on the conversion factor of 2.75 Tg CH4 / ppb given by Prather et al. 2012 DOI: 10.1029/2012gl051440 and the atmospheric growth rates provided in the text in parts per billion per year." Using top-down and bottom-up estimates arrived at different final emissions values for the year 2017:
* Total anthropogenic sources (top-down):0.364 Gt CH<sub>4</sub> / yr,
* Total anthropogenic sources (bottom-up): 0.38 Gt CH<sub>4</sub> / yr,
* Total natural sources (top-down): 0.232 Gt CH<sub>4</sub> / yr,
* Total natural sources (bottom-up): 0.367 Gt CH<sub>4</sub> / yr.

All regional data used in the original publication (Saunois et al., 2020) are available at https://doi.org/10.18160/GCP-CH4-2019, for both bottom-up and top-down estimates. Estimates are provided for 18 geographical regions, as well as three latitudinal bands (<30 N, 30 N - 60 N, 60 N - 90 N).
