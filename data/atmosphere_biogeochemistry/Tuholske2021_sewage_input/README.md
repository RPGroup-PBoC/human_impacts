# Global N Input from Wastewater

## Description
This entry gives the estimated global Nitrogen input from 
anthropogenic wastewater into global watersheds for 2015 

## Key Numbers
| **Quantity** | **Value** | **Units** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Direct sewage input (open defecation) | ≈ 2 | Tg |
| Septic sewage input | ≈ 0.3 | Tg |
| Sewer (partial treatment) input | ≈ 3.7 | Tg |
| Total N input | ≈ 6 | Tg |

## Notes
These data correspond to estimated values of N input from human wastewater in the year 2015. These data are not directly measured but rather use data from the FAO and the GHS-Pop spatial data set. They make some literature estimats for the fraction of N removed from sewage treatment (≈55%) and septic tanks (≈80%). It's assumed that direct input (i.e. open defecation) has no N removal.

Amount of N effluent from human wate comes from estimates of protein consumption per capita. These data are mostly from the FAO but not all localities were reported, requiring some data interpolation.

Finally, these data consider only effects of N input within 1 km of surface waters and coastlines.
