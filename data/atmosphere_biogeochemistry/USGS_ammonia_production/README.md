## Notes
The values reported here are published in the annual USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries in units of thousand metric tons and are converted to units of Mt in the processed dataset. Oftentimes, the value for the most recent year is estimated and is subject to change in the next release of the USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries (MCS). The MCS is released each year since 1996 and gives values for the two prior years. These data are concatenated into the processed csv file by preferentially using the latest value for a given year. They are based on an inventory of production from major ammonia plants. Thus, the value reflects the annual production of ammonia, not the annual usage of ammonia.
