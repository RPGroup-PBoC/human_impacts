# Antarctic Ozone Hole Evolution (NASA Ozone Watch)

## Description
Each year for the past few decades during the Southern Hemisphere spring, chemical reactions involving chlorine and bromine cause ozone in the southern polar region to be destroyed rapidly and severely. This depleted region is known as the “ozone hole”. This dataset contains the maximum ozone hole area and minimum daily ozone amount in the region by year since 1979. The mean ozone hole area and mean minimum ozone amount during the Southern Hemisphere spring are also provided. Retrieved January 22nd 2021.

## Key Numbers

Maximum ozone hole area (2020): ≈ 2.5 &times; 10<sup>13</sup> m<sup>2</sup>

Area of North America (for comparison): ≈ 2.5 &times; 10<sup>13</sup> m<sup>2</sup>

## Notes
The data for 1979–1992 are from the TOMS instrument on the NASA/NOAA Nimbus-7 satellite. The data for 1993–1994 are from the TOMS instrument on the Soviet-built Meteor-3 satellite. The data for 1996–October 2004 are from the NASA Earth Probe TOMS satellite. The data starting from November 2004 through June 2016 are from the OMI instrument (KNMI / NASA) onboard the Aura satellite. They are the OMTO3d that have been processed in a manner similar to the TOMS data from earlier years. The data starting July 2016 are from the OMPS instrument onboard the Suomi NPP satellite.

The ozone minimum is determined only from data actually contained in the processed satellite data. To calculate the ozone hole area, mass deficit, and polar cap ozone missing areas (bad orbits and polar night) are filled using assimilated ozone data (MERRA for 1979 through June 2016, MERRA-2 for July 2016 through August 2017, and GEOS FP from September 2017 on) produced by the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System (GEOS DAS). MERRA and MERRA-2 use a version of the GEOS model with the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) atmospheric analysis developed jointly with NOAA/NCEP/EMC. The GEOS FP system integrates forefront versions of the GEOS atmospheric general circulation model with advanced data assimilation techniques, using a broad range of satellite observations.
