# Radioactive Fallout of Radioisotopes from Atmospheric Weapons Testing

## Description 
This dataset contains tables from the UN report on the sources and effects of ionizing radiation.
Specifically this dataset reports the cumulative radioactivity of a variety of radionuclides 
released from atmospheric weapons testing performed in the middle of the 20th century.

  lengthy (multiple sections, each â‰ˆ 200 pages) and detailed with definitions of terms, 
  mathematics, plots, and raw data tables (including the one reported here.)
