# GLOBAL Land-Ocean Temperature Index

## Description
The GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4) dataset contains global surface temperature change data relative to reference years 1951-1980.

## Key Numbers
Global surface temperature change (2019): 0.98 °C ± ≈ 0.05 °C

## Notes
The data were manually processed by retaining the J-D annual mean, which describes the global annual temperature change, and converting it to °C. The uncertainty is derived from Lenssen et al. 2019, where it is noted that the uncertainty of annual global means since 1960 is approximately ± 0.05 °C.
