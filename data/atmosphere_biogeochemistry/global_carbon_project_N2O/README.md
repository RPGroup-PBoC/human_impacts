# Global Nitrous Oxide Budget

## Description
The Global Nitrous Oxide Budget contains data on N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from anthropogenic and natural sources.

## Key Numbers
* N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from anthropogenic sources (2007-2016): ≈ 7.3 Tg N / yr (min-max [4.2-11.4])
* N<sub>2</sub>O emissions from natural sources (2007-2016): ≈ 9.7 Tg N / yr (min-max [8.0-12.0])
* Anthropogenic N<sub>2</sub>O emissions growth rate (1980s-[2007-2016]): ≈ 0.6 ± 0.2 Tg N / yr

* **Bias**: These data are mostly from original publications but collected and curated in the above publication by the Global Carbon Project, a Global Research Project of Future Earth and a research partner of the World Climate Research Programme. No inherent bias seems to be present.

## Notes
The data were processed by tidying Table 1 of the publication and retaining the categories needed for this analysis. See the source dataset for more granular information and uncertainties.
