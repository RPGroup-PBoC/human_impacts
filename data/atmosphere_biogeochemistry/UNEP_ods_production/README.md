## Notes

Data is aggregated by region: Africa, Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Western Europe and Others. Data is also available by country in the source website. Negative values for a given year in the source data imply that quantities destroyed or quantities exported for the year exceeded the sum of production and imports, implying that the destroyed or exported quantities came from stockpiles. Negative values have been folded to zero, since only gross consumption has an effect on atmospheric chemistry.
