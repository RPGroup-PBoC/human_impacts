# Global potash production for agriculture and agricultural use (FAOSTAT)

## Description
This entry gives the mass of potash (K<sub>2</sub>O) produced for and used for agricultural purposes in the period 1961-2018.

## Key Numbers

Global potash agricultural use (2018): 3.89 &times; 10<sup>10</sup> kg K<sub>2</sub>O / yr

* **Bias**: This FAOSTAT Fertilizers by Nutrient domain is compliant with the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, SEEA AFF. It provides data on inorganic fertilizers, in terms of nutrient content, for the three nutrients included in SEEA AFF: nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. Data from this domain can be used in the compilation, regarding inorganic fertilizers, of the total supply and total use columns of SEEA AFF Table 4.5 “Physical flow account for fertilizers” (FAO & UNSD, 2017).
The FAOSTAT Fertilizers by Nutrient domain also aligns with the Framework for the Development of Environmental Statistics, FDES 2013. Statistics on the amount of chemical fertilizers used for crop production are part of the core set of environmental statistics of FDES (item 2.5.3.b.2). Additionally, statistics on chemical fertilizers used in forestry activities are part of FDES topic 2.5.1, ‘timber resources’, and the total amount of chemical fertilizers used to enrich soils are part of FDES topic 3.4.1, ‘release of chemical substances’. Statistics on production, imports and exports of chemical fertilizers are included in FDES under ‘mineral resources’, in topic 2.1.2 (UNSD 2017) [Link](http://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/documents/RFN/RFN_EN_README.pdf).

## Notes

Data was obtained from the source website by using the filters `World (Total)`, `Production Quantity, Argicultural Use`, `Nutrient potash K2O (total)`, `All Years`.
The main data source for production and agricultural use is the FAOSTAT Fertilizers
questionnaire, complemented with national publications when available. Agricultural use of fertilizers refers to the use for crops, livestock, forestry, fisheries and aquaculture, excluding use for animal feed.

Other plant nutrition uses (such as application to ponds, turf and ornamentals) would be excluded, but limited data availability currently prevents the discrimination of these uses. Therefore, it is assumed that those plant nutrition uses may also be included in the values for agriculture provided in this domain.
Industrial uses, also known as technical uses, are excluded, to the extent allowed by data availability.

Changes in stocks are not considered either, due to lack of information. The impact of stocks in the overall trend of the time series is assumed to be negligible.
Production data represent the tonnes of nutrients manufactured into fertilizer products for agricultural use. Production of certain fertilizers may derive from the transformation of other fertilizers, which can be defined as secondary production. A note on avoiding double counting of nutrients from secondary production is included in the ‘limitations’ section, below.
