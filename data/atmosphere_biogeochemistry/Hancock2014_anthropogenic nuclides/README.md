# Persistence of Radionuclides as Stratigraphic Markers 

## Description 
This dataset presents a view of Pu-239 and Pu-240 as a globally distributed marker 
of the anthropocene. Virtually all of these isotopes on Earth were produced during 
atmospheric nuclear weapons testing during the 1950's and 1960's.

## Key Numbers

Residual Pu-239/240 radioactivity in stratified soils (≈ c 1963) ≈ 1 Bq / kg

Released Mass of Radionuclides

|Radionuclide | Half Life (yrs) |	Fallout (PBq) | Fallout (kg) |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Sr-90 |	28.8 |	622 |	120 |
| Cs-127 |	30.1 |	948	| 300 |
| C-14 |	5730 |	213	| 1290 |
| Pu-241 | 14.4 | 142 | 40 |
| Pu-238 |	88	| 0.3	| 0.4 |
| Pu-239 |	24110 |	6.5 | 2840 |
| Pu-240 |	6563	| 4.4	 | 520 |

Total fallout of Pu-239/240 ≈ 10.9 PBq ≈ 3300 kg

## Notes
* Global Pu-238 fallout does not include the fallout from the SNAP-9A nuclear satellite 
  failure, which released ≈ 0.6 PBq of fallout. 
* Global Pu-239 and Pu-240 fallout does not include the close-in fallout at the 
  pacific proving grounds, which is estimated to be ≈ 5 PBq.
