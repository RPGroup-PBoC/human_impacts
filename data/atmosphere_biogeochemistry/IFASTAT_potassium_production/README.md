# Global production of potassium products (International Fertilizer Association)

## Description
This entry gives the global production mass of potassium products in the years 2008-2019. Potash, or Muriate of Potassium (MOP), is the main Potassium product and the predominant source of K<sub>2</sub>O in fertilizers.

## Key Numbers
Global potash production (2019): 6.6 &times; 10<sup>10</sup> kg / yr

## Notes
MOP is usually refined from sylvinite ore or extracted from carnallitic brine. MOP also used to produce NPK fertilizer as source of potassium and as raw material in industrial uses. MOP has a 60-61% K<sub>2</sub>O content.
