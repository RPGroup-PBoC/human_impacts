# Global concrete consumption

## Description
This entry gives the global consumption of concrete and its requisite components in the year 2012.

## Key Numbers
Global concrete consumption by mass in 2012: 23.437 Gt,
Global concrete consumption by volume in 2012: 10,058,000,000 m<sup>3</sup>

Data are found in a published article: Miller, S. A., Horvath, A., & Monteiro, P. J. (2016). Readily implementable techniques can cut annual CO2 emissions from the production of concrete by over 20%. Environmental Research Letters, 11(7), 074029.
* **Bias**: These results are found in a 2016 scientific publication and are estimated from primary data derived from a variety of government agencies. No bias appears to be present in the primary data or this analysis.

## Notes
The data are present in Table 1 of the source. The data from Table 1 was processed by manually truncating and converting the global data to tidy format. The consumption by mass was calculated by summing over the concrete components â€“ cement, water, and aggregate. See Section 4 of the source supplementary information for more on how the values in Table 1 were calculated.
