# Global concrete consumption

## Description
This entry gives the global consumption of concrete and its requisite components in the year 2012.

## Key Numbers
Global concrete consumption by mass in 2012: 2.34 &times; 10<sup>13</sup> kg /yr,
Global concrete consumption by volume in 2012: 1.0058 &times; 10<sup>10</sup> m<sup>3</sup> / yr

Data are found in a published article: Miller, S. A., Horvath, A., & Monteiro, P. J. (2016). Readily implementable techniques can cut annual CO2 emissions from the production of concrete by over 20%. Environmental Research Letters, 11(7), 074029.
* **Bias**: These results are found in a 2016 scientific publication and are estimated from primary data derived from a variety of government agencies. No bias appears to be present in the primary data or this analysis.

## Notes
The data are present in Table 1 of the source. The data from Table 1 was processed by manually truncating and converting the global data to tidy format. The consumption by mass was calculated by summing over the concrete components â€“ cement, water, and aggregate. Production of cement was determined by USGS estimates for the year 2012. Estimates for the consumption of aggregate and water were estimated from the average composition of concrete mixtures that are used to meet strength requirements. Concrete volume was calculated using these mixture proportions and the density of concrete. See Section 4 of the source supplementary information for more on how the values in Table 1 were calculated.
