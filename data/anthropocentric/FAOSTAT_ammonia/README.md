  It is unlikely to have a strong bias in reporting. Their methods and
  annotations are also exceptionally well documented. These numbers, however,
  should be compared with other data sources and simple estimates.

## Notes
Agricultural use data refers to the use of synthesized nitrogen as fertilizers for agricultural domains including aquaculture, forestry, livestock, and crops but excluding animal feed. Production refers to the nitrogenous fertilizer produced explicitly and only for agricultural use. Thus, this dataset does not include nitrogen used for plastics, explosives, or other uses.
