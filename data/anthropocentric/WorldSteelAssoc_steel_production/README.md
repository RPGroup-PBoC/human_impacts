## Description
This entry gives the global production of crude steel every five years from 1950-1995 and every year from 2000-2019.
This entry also gives regional production of crude steel from 2000-2018.

## Key Numbers
Global steel production (2019): 1869 Mt

The data are similar to other non-commercial sources. Several international economic and scientific bodies consult with the World Steel Association.  

## Notes
The World Steel Association notes that crude steel is steel in its first solid (or usable) form: ingots, semi-finished products (billets, blooms, slabs), and liquid steel for castings.

Global data were tidied manually.

Regional data were tidied manually and a script was written to link the localities in the data source to the regional definitions originally specified by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations that are used in this work. The regional data have a locality category denoted as "Others". This category is a very minor component of global steel production and was removed from the processed regional file. In years 2009-2018, the localities that comprise this category are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mauritania, Mongolia, and Uganda and the values are imputed from pp. 1-3 of the Steel Statistical Yearbook Concise Version 2019.
