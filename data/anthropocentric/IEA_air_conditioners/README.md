# Global Air Conditioner Stock 1990-2016 (IEA)

## Description

Global stock of AC units from 1990 to 2016 as estimated from the international energy agency, defined per region. The world faces a looming “cold crunch.” Using air conditioners and electric fans to stay cool accounts for nearly 20% of the total electricity used in buildings around the world today. And this trend is set to grow as the world’s economic and demographic growth becomes more focused in hotter countries. As incomes and standards of living increase, more people will naturally want to buy and use air conditioners to keep cool. Wider access to cooling is necessary, bringing benefits to human development, health, well-being and economic productivity. But it will have a significant impact on countries’ overall energy demand, putting pressure on electricity grids and driving up local and global emissions.

Nearly 70% of all the ACs globally is in residential buildings. Household ownership of ACs varies enormously across countries, from around 4% in India and less than 10% in Europe, to over 90% in the United States and Japan, and close to 100% in a few Middle Eastern countries.

## Key Numbers

Global stock of AC units (2016) : ≈ 1.6 billion

Air conditioning is highly concentrated in a small number of countries, with two-thirds of all systems in use found in just three countries – China, the United States and Japan.

## Notes

The data were prepared by the IEA for their report *The Future of Cooling*, ([IEA, 2018](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-cooling)). The IEA also provides projections of AC units until 2050, but these have been omitted here as they do not represent actual data, just forecasts. No information is provided about uncertainty in estimates or the methodology of data collection, other than it adheres to the [*IEA standards*](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics).
