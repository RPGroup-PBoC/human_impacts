# Global cement production (United States Geological Survey)

## Description
This entry gives the global production of cement in the years 1994-2021.
This entry also gives the regional production of cement from 2013-2017.

## Key Numbers
Global cement production in 2021: 4.40 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> kg / yr,
Global concrete production in 2021 (see notes for how this was approximated): ≈ 3.08 &times; 10<sup>13</sup> kg / yr

## Notes
The values reported here are published in the annual USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries in units of thousand metric tons and are converted to units of Mt in the processed dataset. Oftentimes, the value for the most recent year is estimated and is subject to change in the next release of the USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries (MCS). The MCS is released each year since 1996 and gives values for the two prior years. These data are concatenated into the processed csv file by preferentially using the latest value for a given year. Cement is the binding material that when wet adheres sand and gravel (aggregates) together to make concrete. The literature notes that cement production can be used to estimate concrete production as it correlates to a 7-fold higher production of concrete <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmat4930">(Monteiro, P., Miller, S. & Horvath, A. Towards sustainable concrete. Nature Mater 16, 698–699 (2017))</a>. Thus, scaling 4.40 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> kg of cement by a factor of 7 yields this estimate of 3.08 &times; 10<sup>13</sup> kg of concrete produced in 2021.
