# Global cement production (United States Geological Survey)

## Description
This entry gives the global production of cement in the years 2018 and 2019.
This entry also gives the regional production of cement from 2013-2017.

## Key Numbers
Global cement production in 2018: 4.05 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> kg / yr,
Global cement production in 2019: 4.1 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> kg / yr (estimated),
Global concrete production in 2019 (see notes for how this was approximated): ≈ 2.87 &times; 10<sup>13</sup> kg / yr

## Notes
The source gives a value for global cement production of 4.1 Gt in 2019. Cement is the binding material that when wet adheres sand and gravel (aggregates) together to make concrete. The literature notes that cement production can be used to estimate concrete production as it correlates to a 7-fold higher production of concrete (Monteiro, P., Miller, S. & Horvath, A. Towards sustainable concrete. Nature Mater 16, 698–699 (2017). https://doi.org/10.1038/nmat4930). Thus, scaling 4.1 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> kg of cement by a factor of 7 yields this estimate of 2.87 &times; 10<sup>13</sup> kg of concrete produced in 2019.
