## Notes
These data are collected by NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and follow on (GRACE-FO) satellites. The gap in 2017-2018 is the time between these missions. The GRACE and GRACE-FO missions made maps of Earth's gravitational field, and thus mass distribution, every 30 days. With these data, movements of ice and water can be tracked. Uncertainty represents one standard deviation and considers only propagation of monthly uncertainties in measurement.
