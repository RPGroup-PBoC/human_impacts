## Notes
These data are collected by NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and follow on (GRACE-FO) satellites. The gap in 2017-2018 is the time between these missions. The GRACE and GRACE-FO missions made maps of Earth's gravitational field, and thus mass distribution, every 30 days. With these data, movements of ice and water can be tracked.
