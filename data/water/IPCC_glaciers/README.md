## Notes
See Appendix 2.A for information on the data collection and processing. See Table 2.A.1 for statistics at a more granular regional level. Data for major subsections of the planet are shown in this truncated dataset which was processed manually. Value corresponds to the trend of annual glacial ice mass loss from major glacierized regions (2006-2015) based on aggregation of geodetic and in situ glaciological observations (original data source: Zemp et al. 2019, DOI:10.1038/s41586-019-1071-0) with satellite gravimetric observations (original data source: Wouters et al. 2019, DOI:10.3389/feart.2019.00096). Uncertainty represents a 95% confidence interval calculated from standard error propagation of the 95% confidence intervals reported in the original sources assuming them to be independent.
