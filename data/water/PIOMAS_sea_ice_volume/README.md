# PIOMAS Arctic Sea Ice Volume Loss

## Description
This dataset gives the decadal Arctic sea ice volume trend as calculated from 1979-October 2020.

## Key Numbers
Arctic Sea Ice Volume Trend (1979-2020): 3.0 x 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>3</sup> / decade (-3 x 10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>3</sup> / yr)

* **Bias**: These data are collected by the Polar Science Center at the University of Washington and were originally reported in a scientific publication with regular updates on a hosted webpage. No bias is readily apparent.

## Notes
The decadal anomaly trend from 1979-October 2020 is given in Figure 1 of the webpage as -3.0 [1000 km<sup>3</sup> / decade]. Uncertainty is based on the uncertainty in the local thickness measurements and refers to the range in trends from three ice volume determination methods.
