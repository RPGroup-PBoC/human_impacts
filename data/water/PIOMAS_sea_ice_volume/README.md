# PIOMAS Arctic Sea Ice Volume Anomaly

## Description
This dataset contains volumes of arctic sea ice for each month from 1979-present given in 10^3 km^3. The decadal anomaly trend is calculated from 1979-present.

## Key Numbers
Arctic Sea Ice Volume Trend (1979-2020): -3.0 x 10^11 m^3 / yr

## Notes
The raw data was processed by adding a month field at the top of the csv file. The decadal anomaly trend from 1979-present is given in Figure 1 of the webpage as -3.0 [1000 km^3 / decade] and was converted from 1000 km^3 / decade to m^3 / yr.
