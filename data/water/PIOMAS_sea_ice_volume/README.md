# PIOMAS Arctic Sea Ice Volume Loss

## Description
This dataset gives the decadal Arctic sea ice volume trend as calculated from 1979-January 2022.

## Key Numbers
Arctic Sea Ice Volume Trend (1979-2022): -3.0 x 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>3</sup> / decade (-3 x 10<sup>11</sup> m<sup>3</sup> / yr)

## Notes
The decadal anomaly trend from 1979-January 2022 is given in Figure 1 of the webpage as -3.0 x 10<sup>3</sup> km<sup>3</sup> / decade and is converted to the yearly trend in the processed dataset. Uncertainty is based on the uncertainty in the local thickness measurements and refers to the range in trends from three ice volume determination methods.
