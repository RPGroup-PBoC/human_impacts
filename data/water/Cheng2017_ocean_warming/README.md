# Linear Trends in Global Ocean Warming

## Description
The linear trend of global ocean heat content (OHC) and temperature increase constructed from in situ temperature data reported for periods 1960–1991 and 1992–2015.

* **Notes**: OHC trends above 2000 m are reported in Table S1 (supplementary information) of the article. OHC trends reported below 2000 m depth are taken from Purkey and Johnson (2010); reference in source article. It is extended to 1960 by Cheng et al. (2017) by assuming a zero heating rate before 1990 below 2000 m, because OHC changes are found to be very small for 700 to 2000 m before 1990. Trends for the full depth used here take the estimates for 0-700 m, 700-2000 m, and below 2000 m, and assume perfect correlation between the estimates at different layers. We assume perfect correlation to give the highest possible level of uncertainty given the data provided in the manuscript.
