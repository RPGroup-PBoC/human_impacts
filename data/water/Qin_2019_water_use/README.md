* **Original License**: No CC license was given with the original manuscript or 
  data. The corresponding author (Yue Qin) is aware of the intended use of this 
  data for a research project and supplied the data without question. 
* **Bias**: The authors do not declare any conflicts of interest. The SI of the 
  paper is very detailed and provides adequate description of how each quantity 
  was calculated from other data sets. The dataset used to generate Figure 1A was not
  provided on the website, but the first author passed along the data within a few 
  days of a request.

## Notes 
The data in Figure 1A of the source was not available from the publisher or hosted 
on an external repository. I (@gchure) reached out to the first author (Dr. Yue Qin)
who graciously and rapidly provided the data used to generate Figure 1 A. She was 
made aware of the use  case for this data and should be acknowledged and cited in 
any subsequent publication.

The values for the breakdown of each sector in 2016 were calculated directly from Figure 1 B - F.
