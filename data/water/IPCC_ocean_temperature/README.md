# IPCC Ocean Heat Uptake

## Description
This dataset contains rates of increase in ocean heat content in the two depth layers 0–700 m and 700–2000 m.

## Key Numbers
The global ocean heat uptake rate for 0-700 m (2005 - 2017): ≈ 5 ZJ / yr,

The global ocean heat uptake rate for 0-2000 m (2005 - 2017): ≈ 9 ZJ / yr.

## Notes
The data were processed into tidy format manually and only observational values for the most recent (2005-2017) period were retained in the processed dataset. This period was chosen because "the 2005–2017 period has the most complete interior ocean data coverage and the greatest consistency between estimates." For details see Table 5.1 on pp. 458 of the full report. The average fluxes in W m<sup>-2</sup> are computed considering Earth's surface area.
