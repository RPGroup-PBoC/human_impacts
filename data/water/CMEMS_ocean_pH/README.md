# EEA/CMEMS Global Mean Sea Water pH

## Description 
This dataset contains average global sea water pH measurements and yearly trends from 1985-2019 as
reported by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and based on a reconstruction method using in situ data and remote sensing data, as well as empirical relationships. Ocean acidification is quantified by a decrease in pH, which is a measure of acidity: a decrease in pH value means an increase in acidity [H<sup>+</sup>]. The observed decrease in ocean pH resulting from increasing concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> is an important indicator of global change.

## Key Numbers
pH as of 2019 ≈ 8.055 ± 0.001

pH as of 1985 ≈ 8.110 ± 0.001

Average yearly change in pH (1985 - 2019) ≈ -0.0016 ± 0.0006
 
Average yearly change in [H<sup>+</sup>] (1985 - 2019) ≈ +(0.37 ± 0.17) %

* **Source**: European Environment Agency (EEA) and Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS)
* **URL**: Both the EEA (https://www.eea.europa.eu/ims/ocean-acidification) and the CMEMS (https://marine.copernicus.eu/access-data/ocean-monitoring-indicators/global-ocean-mean-sea-water-ph-time-series-and-trend-multi) websites house the data. The raw data was obtained from the pop-up [link](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/figures/decline-in-ocean-ph-measured) *explore the Decline in ocean pH...* in Figure 1. The reported yearly change in pH can be found as part of the original Excel sheet.

* **Bias**: Data comes from the European Union operated satellite monitoring service "Copernicus".
  It is unlikely that this data is highly influenced by the governmental objectives 
  as it is a global measure of ocean pH. The data also agree with non-EU governmental
  services such as NOAA and NASA.
* **Notes**: The indicator is available at annual resolution, from the year 1985 onwards. The error on each yearly value varies, and is added in the data file sheet. The estimated yearly uncertainty envelope is defined as the annual mean of pH ± 2 times the standard deviation, which corresponds to a 95 % confidence interval of the mean estimate. The estimated global mean surface seawater pH is based on alkalinity values (obtained using the locally interpolated alkalinity regression (LIAR) method after [Carter et al.](https://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10087)), surface ocean partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (pCO<sub>2</sub>) (CMEMS product) and an evaluation of a gridded field of ocean surface pH values based on CO<sub>2</sub> system calculations (see [Copernicus Marine Service](https://marine.copernicus.eu/access-data/ocean-monitoring-indicators/global-mean-sea-water-ph), 2021).
