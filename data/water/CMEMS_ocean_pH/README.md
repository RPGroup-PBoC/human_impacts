# CMEMS Global SMean Sea Water pH

## Description 
This dataset contains average global sea water pH measurements from 1985-2018 as
reported by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and based on a reconstruction method using in situ data and remote sensing data, as well as empirical relationships.

## Key Numbers
pH as of 2018 ≈ 8.05 ± 0.01
pH as of 1985 ≈ 8.109 ± 0.001

Calculated yearly change in pH (2018 - 1985) ≈ -0.001 
Calculated yearly change in pH (average over 2013-2018) ≈ -0.0016
 
Calculated yearly change in [H+] ≈ -0.2%

* **Source**: Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS)

* **Bias**: Data comes from the European Union operated satellite monitoring service "Copernicus".
  It is unlikely that this data is highly influenced by the governmental objectives 
  as it is a global measure of ocean pH. The data also agree with non-EU governmental
  services such as NOAA and NASA.
* **Notes**: The indicator is available at annual resolution, from the year 1985 onwards. The error on each yearly value varies, and is added in the data file sheet. The estimated yearly uncertainty envelope is defined as the annual mean of pH ± 2 times the standard deviation, which corresponds to a 95 % confidence interval of the mean estimate.
