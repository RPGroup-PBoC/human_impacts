# NOAA Sea Ice Index, Version 3

## Description
The Sea Ice index provides satellite data for sea ice extent (the area containing > 15% ice) and area (calculated by multiplying the percentage of sea ice in each pixel by pixel area) in the northern and southern hemispheres from 1979-present. NOAA recommends using these data to look at long-term trends in sea ice cover.

## Key Numbers
Rate of change in Arctic sea ice extent in March (maximum yearly extent, relative to 1981-2010 average): -40,400 km^2/yr

Rate of change of Arctic sea ice extent in September (minimum yearly extent, relative to 1981-2010 average): -83,700 km^2/yr

## Notes
Data is current through the end of September, 2020.

The monthly extent and area data were processed by concatenating csv files that contain data for each month on an annual basis. Separate data files are available for sea ice in the northern and southern hemispheres.

The trend in Antarctic sea ice is not included in the key numbers as the long term trend is not clear per the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, Chapter 3: "It is very likely that Antarctic sea ice cover exhibits no significant trend over the period of satellite observations
(1979–2018). While the drivers of historical decadal variability are known with medium confidence, there is currently limited evidence and low agreement concerning causes of the strong recent decrease (2016–2018), and low confidence in the ability of current-generation climate models to reproduce and explain the observations."
