# NOAA Sea Ice Index, Version 3

## Description
The Sea Ice index provides satellite data for sea ice extent (the area containing > 15% ice) and area (calculated by multiplying the percentage of sea ice in each pixel by pixel area) in the northern and southern hemispheres from 1979-present. NOAA recommends using these data to look at long-term trends in sea ice cover.

## Key Numbers
This dataset describes sea ice extent, yet does not include any analysis of trends or comparisons.

* **Bias**: The data is available at NSIDC, a CoreTrustSeal Repository that maintains and distributes data on the cryosphere. These data were collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) a U.S. Government Agency. 

## Notes
The data were processed by concatenating csv files that contain data for each month on an annual basis. Separate data files are available for sea ice in the northern and southern hemispheres.
