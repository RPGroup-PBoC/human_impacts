# Annual Mass Balance of Reference Glaciers

## Description
This dataset contains information on the mass balance of a set of reference glaciers. This mass balance reflects a set of ~40 reference glaciers throughout glaciated regions that have been monitored for long enough to measure climate related changes.

## Key Numbers
Cumulative glacier mass balance 1970-2019: -23,655 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,
Glacier mass balance 2019: -1131 kg/m<sup>2</sup>,
Years since 1970 with positive glacier mass balance: 2

Per their about page: "The WGMS is a service of the International Association of the Cryospheric Sciences of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IACS, IUGG) as well as of the World Data System of the International Science Council (ISC, formerly ICSU) and works under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UN Environment), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)."

## Notes
The dataset records mass balance in the terms of mm.w.e. (millimeters water equivalent) or kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The data required no processing or tidying. The column MB_REF_count corresponds to the number of glaciers tracked per year. The column REF_regionAVG refers to the average mass loss in a given year from glaciers averaged by region. REF_regionAVG_cum-rel-1970 refers to the cumulative average mass loss relative to 1970 from glaciers averaged by region.
