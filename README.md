# The Great Human Experiment by the Numbers

Welcome! This repository collects and annotates data sets pertaining to the
impacts humans have on the earth writ large and serves as the central data source for
the [Human Impacts Database]().  The repository is
open to the public, though please contact [Griffin](http://mailto:gchure@caltech.edu) if
you are interested in becoming a contributing member to the effort. You do not need special
permissions to clone or fork this repository or to submit pull requests. As this is a living, breathing
research repository, the structure and scope of the repository is subject to change at any point in 
time without warning.


## Using The Repository
If you are interested in contributing to this repository, please contact [Griffin](http://mailto:gchure@caltech.edu). You do not require any special permissions to fork the repository and submit pull requests.


Being able to use Git and GitHub is vital to keep track of the data. There are 
many tutorials showing how to use both of these efficiently. If you are not
familiar with Git and GitHub, please review the following tutorials:

meaningful commit messages. 

## Repository Structure

> :warning: An example data file has been added to `flora_fauna/` if you want to
> learn by example how to manage this repository.


The general layout of this repository follows the [ReproducibleResearch](https://github.com/gchure/reproducible_research) 
template. All primary data are stored in the `data` directory of the root folder. Data sources are categorized 
into a primary type of human and Earth-system interaction (such as land use, agriculture, water use, etc). These 
categorizations all all preliminary and subject to change. 


Within each folder, you
will find a `README.md` file explaining the purpose of the folder and other
information that will help you manage the repository. The structure of this
repository is very much in its infancy and may change! Keep track of this
`README.md` file to see if things are changing. 

If you are confused with the layout of the repository or have comments on how
things could be changed to improve it, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/rpgroup-pboc/human_impacts/issues) on this
repository.

This repository houses all *raw* data sets collected from databases, primary scientific literature, 
organizational and/or governmental reports, and industry datasets. This
repository is broken down into four separate subdirectories. Of course, some
data sets will fall into multiple categories. When adding your data to the
repository, choose what you think is the best match. 
+ **`agriculture`**: All data sets related to food generation and consumption. 
+ **`water`**: All data sets related to water consumption and usage. 
+ **`atmosphere_biogeochemistry`**: All data sets related to atmospheric impacts and biogeochemical cycles. 
+ **`land_use`**: All data sets related to land usage. This may include data
  relating to anthropomass, farmland, city sizes, etc. 
+ **`flora_fauna`**: All data sets pertaining to humans impact on the biosphere. 
+ **`energy`**: All datasets pertaining to energy generation, consumption, and harvesting.
+ **`anthropocentric`**: All datasets specifically pertaining to the anthroposphere, including global populations,
anthropomass production, etc.
+ **`other`**: All data sets which do not fit into any of the above categories.

Within each of these subdirectories, there will be yet *another* directory
for a given data set. The naming of this subdirectory is much less clear cut
and will depend on the nature of the data set. That being said, you should
name the folder of your deposited data set in a clear manner. For example,
say you collect a data set which tabulates the global population by country
for the years 1820 - 2020. You would deposit this data set under
`flora_fauna` in another directory titled `world_population_1820-2020`.
Within this folder, you would deposit the data along with a `README.md` file,
as is described in the next section.

## Data Types
Data can be added to these folders in a variety of formats, but they must be
text-based. This means that spreadsheets (`.xslx` or `.numbers`) should be
converted to plain-text data formats (`.txt` or `.csv`) whenever possible.
Large data sets (â‰¥ 100 MB) will need to be added using the [GitHub Large File
Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) system. *Email Griffin
(`gchure@caltech.edu`) for guidance on how to deal with this.* Some of the
data you collect in this data set may be a single number or statistic. Even if
this is the case, it should be added to this folder as a text-based file. 

In general, data should be stored in a [longform, tidy
format](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10). In this format, each
measurement will get one row. Unfortunately, the raw data you get from the
internet will rarely be in this very convenient format meaning that you will
have to reformat your data to be "tidy". 

For example, Consider the world population in our fictional data set described
above. The raw data set may look something like the following:

| country | 1820 | 1821 | 1822 | ...|
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Afghanistan | 3290000 | 3300000| 3310000| ... |
| Albania | 437000| 439000 | 441000| ... |
| ... | ...| ... |... |...| 


This is **not** in tidy format. Rather than having each year as a column, each
year would be a row. Transforming the data into tidy format would make it look
like the following:

| country | year | population |
|:--|:--|:--|
|Afghanistan| 1820 | 32900000|
|Afghanistan| 1821 | 3300000 |
|Afghanistan| 1822 | 3310000 |
| ... | ... | ... |
|Albania | 1820 | 437000 |
|Albania | 1821 | 439000 | 
|Albania | 1822 | 441000 |
| ... | ... |...| 

To ensure that things are properly transformed, you should include the raw data
and the tidy data in the repository.  The original data for our hypothetical
example would be saved as 

```
world_population_1820-2020_raw.csv
```

with the tidy format being renamed to 

```
world_population_1820-2020_tidy.csv
```

For large data sets, this is impossible to do manually and this may require some
computational cleaning of data. 

## Annotation
Every data set you add to this repository *MUST* be accompanied by `README.md`
file describing several features of the data set. This is not optional and
*MUST* follow a particular structure outlined in `README_TEMPLATE.md`. 

The data set readme file has several fields which you will need to populate when
you add your data set. This will make curating the data sets much more manageable
and human readable. Please see the `README_TEMPLATE.md` file for more
information about what to include. 

## Software
Any code you write to analyze a data set must be housed within a `code`
subdirectory in your deposited data folder. Consider our example of a
hypothetical data set containing the global population from the years
1820-2020 by country. Say that you wanted to generate a plot of the
population of Brazil over these years using python. The script you use to
generate the plot (`brazil_population.py`)  and the generated plot itself 
(`brazil_population.pdf`) would be housed in the associated folders as
follows. 

```
flora_fauna /
|
|--> world_population_1820-2020/
     |
     | --> world_population_1820-2020_raw.csv
     | --> world_population_1820-2020_tidy.csv
     | --> code/
           |
           |--> brazil_population.py
     | --> media/
           |
           |--> brazil_population.pdf
```

Please see the  data set already present in this directory for a complete example.

## `anthro` software module
This project comes with a custom Python software package titled `anthro` which
will be used repeatedly to clean, annotate, collate, and present the data
contained in this repository.

To run many of the scripts involved in cleaning and presentation of data within
this repository, you will need to have the `anthro` package locally installed.
Assuming you have cloned this repository, you can install the package using the
following command,

> pip install -e .

assuming you are in the root directory. 

## License
All data sources carry with them the licenses they had when they were released. **Please 
see the `README.md` files within each dataset directory for information regarding 
the original data licensing and preferred citations.`
