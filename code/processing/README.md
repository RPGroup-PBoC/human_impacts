## `processing`

This folder contains all code executed to transform or generate data. Within this directory, there should be subdirectories that contain summaries of that experiment, the code used to process and transform the data, and the output of any processing functions.

Individual subdirectories should have names that can be easily read and
understood by both human eyes and your computer. The subdirectory shown here
as an example has the foldername `YEAR-MONTH-DATE_experiment_description`.
Note that all spaces are replaced with underscores (`_`) which will make any
computational iteration through the folders simpler. In general, spaces in
file and folder names should be avoided at all costs. 

Within each subdirectory, there exists another `README.md` file that gives a summary of that particular experimental run. See the example for more information.
