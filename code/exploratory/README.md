## `exploratory`

Almost nobody goes into a research project knowing exactly how to solve the problem. The scientific process often requires many attempts at solving a problem, processing a data set, performing a regression, or myriad other ways of thinking about the problem. As a result, one often generates many files of failed approaches before the "correct way" is found. Rather than having these files clutter your desktop or your `analysis` folder, you can put all of those files here. 

Once you arrive at a working bit of code, you should save it as a reduced template file and save it in the `templates` directory in the project root. You can keep all of your other attempts here in case you have to go back or if someone wants to see how else you attempted to solve the problem.
